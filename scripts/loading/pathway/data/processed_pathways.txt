THREOCAT2-PWY	threonine degradation	CYS3|CHA1	1628804|2841185|3289762|8132653|3086094|3117785	Threonine degradation can occur via several routes in the budding yeast <i>S. cerevisiae</i>. In the first route, threonine is deaminated to produce ammonia and -ketobutyrate. This reaction is catalyzed by the so-called ""catabolic threonine (and serine) deaminase Cha1p or the biosynthetic threonine deaminase Ilv1p. Cha1p enables <i>S. cerevisiae</i> to produce ammonia from the catabolism of serine or threonine, consequently enabling the use of either amino acid as a sole source of nitrogen. In contrast, Ilv1p is thought to serve a mainly biosynthetic role by degrading threonine to -ketobutyrate, the initial substrate for isoleucine biosynthesis. CHA1 is transcriptionally induced by serine and threonine, whereas ILV1 is regulated by general control of amino acid biosynthesis.  The second route of threonine degradation occurs via threonine aldolase, encoded by GLY1 in <i>S. cerevisiae<i>. Threonine aldolase directly cleaves threonine to form glycine and acetaldehyde. Disruption of GLY1 leads to strongly reduced growth in minimal media lacking glycine, suggesting that threonine catabolism via threonine aldolase is the major source of glycine in <i>S. cerevisiae<i>.  The third, putative route of threonine degradation in <i>S. cerevisiae<i> is the NAD-dependent oxidation of threonine to 2-amino-3-oxobutanoate. In many organisms, this reaction is catalyzed by threonine dehydrogenase (TDH). The existence of this enzyme in <i>S. cerevisiae<i> is uncertain, however low levels of TDH activity have been reported in one study (see Murata et al., 1986). <i>S. cerevisiae<i> also lacks 2-amino-3-ketobutyrate CoA ligase (KBL), the enzyme responsible for converting the product of TDH (2-amino-3-oxobutanoate) to glycine. Because 2-amino-3-oxobutanoate is unstable, the fate of this product in <i>S. cerevisiae<i> is presumed to be spontaneous decarboxylation to aminoacetate.

PWY3O-10	fatty acid biosynthesis, initial steps	CEM1|MCT1|FAS2|OAR1|HFA1|ACC1|FAS1	18059524	Fatty acids are essential to all organisms except for archaea; they are major constituents of cellular membranes, and are used for energy storage and for posttranslational protein modifications. Most organisms are capable of synthesizing long chain (C12:0-C16:0) saturated fatty acids de novo.  Although the initiation and termination reactions may vary, the cyclic series of chain-lengthening reactions are essentially the same across all organisms. The fatty acid chain, which starts as a 2-carbon chain from acetyl-CoA, is extended two carbons at a time by the addition of an acetyl group from malonyl-CoA.  When the final length of the fatty acid is achieved, fatty acid synthesis is terminated.  Each cycle of chain elongation involves 5 reactions with the following enzymatic activities: malonyl transferase (EC: 2.3.1.39), ketoacyl synthase (EC: 2.3.1.41), ketoacyl reductase (EC: 1.1.1.100), 3-hydroxyacyl dehydratase (EC: 4.2.1.58, 4.2.1.59, and 4.2.1.61), and enoyl-acyl reductase (EC: 1.3.1.10). In yeast, fatty acid biosynthesis is terminated with the release of fatty acyl-CoAs from fatty acid synthase (FAS), the enzyme complex that carries out de novo fatty acid biosynthesis.  Palmitoyl- (C16) and stearoyl-CoA (C18) are the main products in yeast, while myristoyl-CoA (C14) is only produced in small amounts To synthesize palmitoyl-CoA (C16) one acetyl-CoA and 7 malonyl-CoA molecules are required.  The elongation substrate, malonyl-CoA is synthesized from the carboxylation of acetyl-CoA (EC 6.4.1.2) by the biotin-containing enzyme, acetyl-CoA carboxylase (Acc1p) Acetyl-CoA carboxylase is activated by the biotin:apoprotein ligase (Bpl1p) There are two types of FAS systems based on the organization of the catalytic sites. Fungi, animals, and some bacteria have type I FASs, which are large multi-functional proteins that contain all of the requisite catalytic active sites for fatty acid biosynthesis within domains on a single polypeptide (alpha) or on two polypeptides (alpha and beta). Fungal FASs are alpha6beta6 heterododecamers, animal FASs are alpha2 homodimers, and some type I bacterial FASs are alpha6 Bacteria, plants and mitochondria, on the other hand, have type II FAS systems, which are comprised of independent proteins, whereby each protein catalyzes a single step in the cyclic series of reactions The yeast FAS complex catalyzes a total of 8 reactions. The alpha subunit(Fas2p) catalyzes 3 reactions, ketoacyl synthase (EC: 2.3.1.41),ketoacyl reductase (EC: 1.1.1.100) and self pantetheinylation and the yeast beta subunit (Fas1p) catalyzes 5 reactions, acetyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.38), malonyl transferase (EC: 2.3.1.39),3-hydroxyacyl dehydratase (EC: 4.2.1.58, 4.2.1.59, and 4.2.1.61),enoyl-acyl reductase (EC: 1.3.1.10), and palmitoyl transferase (EC:2.3.1.-) FASs are regulated at the transcriptional and translational level as well as posttranslationally.  In yeast, FAS is a housekeeping enzyme that is expressed constitutively at a low level, but its expression is also activated by the general yeast transcription factors Rap1, Abf1 and Reb1 and theinositolcholine-responsive transcription factor heterodimer, Ino2p-Ino4p The coordinate expression of the two subunits also appears to be regulated by Fas1p controlling the expression of FAS2 The FAS subunits are further regulated by proteolytic degradation of excess subunits. While the intact FAS multimeric complex (alpha6beta6 ) is stable, its individual subunits are rapidly degraded	1350093|7649444|17448991|15952903|365179|1100391|10785388|3528750|374077|7925441|1461729|7862526|11713312|1735446|8262967	butyryl-ACP biosynthesis|de novo fatty acid biosynthesis|fasyn1|fatty acid biosynthesis, initial reactions	CINDY
GLYOXYLATE-BYPASS	glyoxylate cycle	MDH2|MDH3|DAL7|MLS1|ICL1|CIT2|ACO2|ACO1	12455685|15975908	The glyoxylate cycle, also called the glyoxylate shunt, is present in fungi, plants, and bacteria, but not in  mammals. The cycle is essential for growth on two-carbon compounds such as ethanol and acetate, and  plays an anaplerotic role in the provision of precursors for biosynthesis.  The glyoxylate cycle is  comprised of many of the same reactions as the TCA cycle, but it does not include the two  decarboxylation reactions.  As a result, two-carbon substrates, which enter the cycle as acetyl-CoA, can be converted to four-carbon compounds, which in turn can be further metabolized to create sugars and other essential  organic compounds.  Although several of the reactions of the glyoxylate and TCA cycle are identical, many of them are  catalyzed by different isozymes in different cellular compartments. The glyoxylate cycle occurs in the  peroxisome and cytoplasm, while the TCA cycle occurs in the mitochondria. Utilization of two-carbon  compounds by yeast also requires the TCA cycle and gluconeogenesis, which are coordinately regulated  with the glyoxylate cycle.  The succinate provided by the glyoxylate cycle enters the TCA cycle where it  is converted to malate; malate then reenters the cytoplasm where it is converted to oxaloacetate and  eventually to glucose via gluconeogenesis.  The key enzymes of the glyoxylate cycle, isocitrate lyase and malate synthase, as well as malate dehydrogenase, are regulated in yeast in response to the carbon source of the growth medium. Synthesis of these enzymes is repressed in cells grown on glucose and derepressed in media lacking glucose (as reported in Although S. cerevisiae is rarely found in human hosts, phagocytosis of S. cerevisiae by mammalian macrophages results in the induction of genes encoding glyoxylate cycle enzymes; this is thought to be a response to the nutrient-poor environment of the phagolysosome	5345986|12455685|11452311	glyoxylate bypass|glyoxylate shunt	CINDY

Other fungi and eukaryotes have additional fatty acid desaturases that can produce double bonds in the delta12 and delta15 position.  The Ole1p sequence is similar to homologs in rat and human (SCD1) over the majority of the protein, including a cluster of histidine residues that coordinate the binding of a diiron-oxo prosthetic group within the catalytic site (reviewed in The rat and yeast proteins are similar enough that exogenously expressed rat protein can rescue an ole1 null mutant However, Ole1p has an additional C-terminal, 113 amino acid extension (relative to the rat protein), which encodes a cytochrome b5-like domain not found in mammalian desaturases. In animal cells, cytochrome b5 is thought to be the electron donor for fatty acid desaturation.

The net effect of the electron transport chain is to transfer electrons from NADH to molecular oxygen, coupled to transport of protons across the mitochondrial inner membrane.  The proton transport creates an electrochemical gradient across the membrane, which is then used to power ATP synthesis by the mitochondrial inner membrane F1F0 ATP synthase as well as transport of metabolites across the membrane NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (NADH dehdrogenase) catalyzes the oxidation of NADH by ubiquinone, generating ubiquinol and NAD+ In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Candida glabata and Schizosaccharomyces pombe, a single-subunit enzyme provides this activity (Ndi1p in S. cerevisiae).  In many other fungi, mammals,  insects, and plants, this activity resides in a multisubunit complex, Complex I, which transports a proton across the mitochondrial inner membrane concomitantly with NADH oxidation The succinate dehydrogenase complex (Complex II) catalyzes the oxidation of succinate by ubiquinone to fumarate, generating ubiquinol and fumarate.  This reaction does not result in transfer of a proton across the mitochondrial inner membrane. In S. cerevisiae the complex is composed of the flavoprotein subunit Sdh1p, the iron-sulfur protein subunit Sdh2p, the cytochrome b subunit Sdh3p, and the membrane anchor subunit Sdh4p The ubiquinol generated by NADH dehydrogenase and Complex II is oxidized to ubiquinone by ubiquinol-cytochrome-c reductase (Complex III; cytochrome bc1 complex) in a stepwise electron transfer through the complex that results in the reduction of cytochrome c and the transfer of a proton across the mitochondrial membrane The cytochrome c that is reduced in this step is the product of the CYC1 gene.  The final step in the electron transport chain is catalyzed by Complex IV, cytochrome c oxidase, which oxidizes  cytochrome c while reducing oxygen to water with the concomitant transport of a proton across the mitochondrial inner membrane	11245784|11245784|1900238|11245784|14672929|12788490|1665335|7851399	aerobic respiration (cyanide sensitive)--electron donors	CINDY
PWY-781	sulfate assimilation pathway	MET3|MET14|MET10|MET5|MET16|TRX1|TRX2|TRX3	9409150|16102596|22419079	Sulfur is found in many important biological compounds, including the amino acids methionine and cysteine, the coenzymes biotin and coenzyme A, and other metabolites such as glutathione. Although most of these compounds contain reduced sulfur, in nature the major form of inorganic sulfur available to many microorganisms is sulfate. In order to use sulfate to synthesize organic sulfur compounds, particularly sulfur amino acids and their derivatives, plants and many microorganisms import and reduce sulfate via the sulfate assimilation pathway.  In <i>S. cerevisiae<i>, the sulfate assimilation pathway consists of sulfates uptake via Sul1p and Sul2p, activation to adenylate compounds, reduction to sulfide, and subsequent incorporation into carbon chains. The importance of activating sulfate to adenylyl sulfate (APS) and phosphoadenylyl sulfate (PAPS) stems from the fact that physiological reducing agents (e.g. NADPH, NADH) are not large enough in E<sub>0<sub>' to reduce sulfate directly. Adenylation lowers sulfate's electropotential, enabling cells to circumvent what would otherwise be an endergonic reaction. After its conversion to PAPS, sulfate is reduced to sulfite by PAPS reductase (Met16p) and again to sulfide by sulfite reductase (Met5p and Met10p). The subsequent incorporation of sulfide into a carbon chain varies by organism; in <i>S. cerevisiae<i>, sulfide can react with O-acetylhomoserine via Met17p to form homocysteine, the major intermediate in the biosynthesis and interconversion of methionine and cysteine. In plants and enteric bacteria, sulfide can react with O-acetylserine to form cysteine directly.  The induction of all genes involved in the <i>S. cerevisiae<i> sulfate assimilation pathway depends upon the leucine-zipper transcriptional activator Met4p. Met4p induces MET gene expression in cysteine-limiting conditions, while under cysteine-rich conditions Met4p transcriptional activity is negatively regulated by the ubiquitin ligase SCF(Met30). Furthermore, sulfur transport is inhibited in this organism by intracellular sulfate and sulfur metabolites such as APS and cysteine.  References:	9409150|16102596|22419079	sulfate assimilation	CINDY

In <i>S. cerevisiae</i>, de novo synthesis of PA occurs primarily through two acylation pathways: the glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P) pathway and the dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) pathway. In both routes of PA synthesis, G3P and DHAP are converted to lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and subsequently acylated to PA by 1-acyl-sn-G3P acyltransferases (Slc1p, Ale1p, and Loa1p). G3P/DHAP acyltransferases (Sct1p and Gpt2p) catalyze the first step in both pathways, acylating G3P to LPA or DHAP to 1-acyl-DHAP. Further conversion of 1-acyl-DHAP to LPA occurs via a NADPH-dependent reaction catalyzed by 1-acyl-DHAP reductase (Ayr1p). After its formation from LPA, PA can be cleaved to diacylglycerol by phosphatidate phosphatases (Pah1p, Dpp1p, Lpp1p, and App1p) for the biosynthesis of triacylglycerols. Alternatively, PA can be converted by CDP-DAG synthases (Cds1p and Tam41p) to cytidine diphosphate diacylglycerol (CDP-DAG), the precursor to all major phospholipids in <i>S. cerevisiae</i>.  The universal route of PA biosynthesis is the G3P pathway, which exists in prokaryotes, plants, yeast, and mammalian cells. In contrast, the DHAP pathway is present only in yeast and mammals. Aside from these de novo pathways, PA synthesis may also occur through alternative routes such as phosphorylation of diacylglycerol by DAG kinase (Dgk1p in yeast) and hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine by phospholipase D (Spo14p in yeast).

The roles of PE in the cell are many: it contributes to membrane architecture, influences the structure and activity of integral and peripheral membrane proteins, is required for mitochondrial function in yeast, and plays important roles in cell division and autophagy. In addition, PE donates the phosphoethanolamine required for the biosynthesis of glycosylphosphatidylinositol, a lipid anchor involved in attaching proteins to the cell surface.  In <i>S. cerevisiae<i>, the major route of PE synthesis involves the production and decarboxylation of phosphatidylserine. Alternatively, <i>S. cerevisiae<i> can synthesize PE from free ethanolamine via the CDP-ethanolamine branch of the Kennedy pathway. This route consists of three steps: 1) phosphorylation of ethanolamine to phosphoethanolamine by ethanolamine kinase (Eki1p) or choline kinase (Cki1p), 2) activation of phosphoethanolamine to CDP-ethanolamine by phosphoethanolamine cytidylyltransferase (Ect1p), and 3) transfer of a phosphoethanolamine moiety from CDP-ethanolamine to diacylglycerol by 1,2-diacylglycerol ethanolaminephosphotransferase (Ept1p). The other branch of the Kennedy pathway, the CDP-choline pathway, analogously incorporates choline into phosphatidylcholine (PC).  The Kennedy pathway is not essential in yeast. Nevertheless, it plays an important role in PE and PC synthesis when the preferred de novo pathways are disrupted or repressed. This stands in contrast to mammalian cells, where the Kennedy pathway represents the major route of synthesis and is essential for mammalian development.

Instead, <i>S. cerevisiae</i> obtains cytosolic acetyl-CoA through the activation of acetate. Acetate activation to acetyl-CoA occurs via the enzyme acetyl-CoA synthetase, which catalyzes the ATP-dependent ligation of acetate and coenzyme A to form acetyl-CoA. Two genes encode for acetyl-CoA synthetase in <i>S. cerevisiae</i>: ACS1 and ACS2. ACS1 is a glucose-repressed gene required for growth on acetate during glucose starvation, while ACS2 is a constitutively expressed gene essential for cell viability in glucose medium. ACS1 is repressed by Ume6p and is activated by Adr1p and Cat8p in the absence of glucose.

PERIPLASMA-NAD-DEGRADATION	periplasmic NAD degradation	NPY1	19416965|16278456	In some organisms, the metabolism of extracellular nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) plays an important role in purine salvage and uptake. In humans, for instance, extracellular NAD+ generated via cell lysis or other means can be salvaged for adenine through the following steps: 1) cleavage of NAD+ to AMP and nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) by NAD+ pyrophosphatase, 2) cleavage of AMP to release adenosine via 5-nucleotidase, 3) transport of extracellular adenosine into the cell via adenosine transporters, and 4) regeneration of adenine nucleotides from adenosine via phosphorylation. This process has been implicated human immune cell activation. <p> Extracellular metabolism of NMN, but not NAD+, is known to occur in <i>S. cerevisiae<i>. This occurs via Pho5p, the major secreted acid phosphatase in yeast. Pho5p catalyzes the conversion of exogenous NMN in the periplasm to nicotinamide riboside (NR), a NAD+ precursor that can be imported into the cell and converted back to NAD+ via salvage pathways. Deletion of PHO5 prevents growth of a mutant disrupted in the NAD+ biosynthesis pathway on medium containing NMN. In addition to Pho5p, two other enzymes are known to play a role in catabolizing extracellular nucleotides in <i>S. cerevisiae<i>: the nucleotide pyrophosphatasesphosphodiesterases Npp1p and Npp2p. Both yeast enzymes belong to a superfamily of alkaline phosphatases that also includes extracellular 5-nucleotidases from mammals.  References:	19416965|16278456		OTTO
PWY3O-4	carnitine shuttle	YAT1|YAT2|CAT2	20889721|18427809|11329169	In eukaryotes, metabolism is compartmented and does not occur homogenously throughout the cell. As a consequence, membrane-impermeable metabolites produced in one cellular compartment often cannot support biochemical pathways in another compartment unless they are transferred to the site of action. Several mechanisms exist in eukaryotes for the translocation of acetyl-coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) between cellular compartments. The carnitine shuttle, which uses carnitine to carry activated acetyl from coenzyme A across intracellular membranes, is one such example. In <i>S. cerevisiae</i>, acetyl-CoA can be generated in the peroxisome via fatty acid -oxidation and in the cytoplasm via degradation of non-fermentable carbon sources. The carnitine shuttle plays an important role in transporting the activated acetyl generated from these processes into mitochondria for further metabolism in the TCA cycle.  The carnitine shuttle begins with the transfer of an acetyl group from acetyl-CoA to carnitine via carnitine acetyltransferase (CAT), forming acetyl-carnitine. There are several CATs in <i>S. cerevisiae<i>: Cat2p, localized in peroxisomes and mitochondria; Yat1p, localized on the outer mitochondrial membrane; and Yat2p, localized in the cytosol. After its formation, acetyl-carnitine is transported into the mitochondrion via carnitine acylcarnitine translocase (Crc1p). Mitochondrial CAT (Cat2p) then catalyzes the reverse transfer of the acetyl group from acetyl-carnitine to coenzyme A, regenerating acetyl-CoA and carnitine inside the mitochondrion.

Glycogen metabolism increases in response to a wide variety of environmental stresses, including heat stress or exposure to sodium chloride, hydrogen peroxide, copper sulfate, high levels of ethanol, or weak organic acids, such as sorbate or benzoate . Glycogen metabolism also increases in response to conditions of nutrient starvation, such as limited nitrogen, carbon, phosphorous, or sulfur, and during diauxic growth on glucose .  In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, glycogen biosynthesis involves three processes: nucleation, elongation, and branching (also known as ramification) . The formation of glycogen begins when either Glg1p or Glg2p uses UDP-glucose to self-glucosylate to produce a short alpha (1,4)-glucosyl chain covalently attached to one of their internal tyrosine residues . After the self-glucosylation of Glg1p or Glg2p, glycogen synthase is able to extend the linear alpha (1,4)-glucosyl chains of glycogen by catalyzing the formation of alpha (1,4)-glucosidic bonds from UDP- glucose at the non-reducing ends . Branches can be added into the glycogen molecule by Glc3p, which is the glycogen branching enzyme (EC:2.4.1.18) in S. cerevisiae .

For its ability to sustain continuous oxidation-reduction cycles, ubiquinone functions as both a membrane antioxidant and an electron carrier in many cellular pathways. In the electron transport chain, it transfers electrons from complex I and complex II to complex III. Ubiquinone is composed of a quinone core and a polyisoprenoid tail whose chain length varies according to species. The principal ubiquinone in <i>S. cerevisiae</i> has six subunits (CoQ6), whereas mice and humans have nine (CoQ9) and ten (CoQ10) subunits, respectively.  In yeast, the polyisoprenoid tail of ubiquinone derives from the two main products of the mevalonate pathway: dimethylallyl-pyrophosphate (DPP) and isopentenyl-pyrophosphate (IPP). The condensation of DPP with one or more units of IPP produces short-chain polyprenyl diphosphates, such as farnesyl-PP (FPP) and geranylgeranyl-PP (GGPP), which serve as precursors for many primary metabolites. In the CoQ biosynthetic pathway, these short-chain molecules are further extended by long-chain polyprenyl diphosphate synthases. <i>S. cerevisiae<i> Coq1p (hexaprenyl pyrophosphate synthase) extends the isoprenoid subunit length of FPP or GGPP to six subunits, forming the hexaprenyl precursor to the polyprenyl tail of CoQ6.  <i>S. cerevisiae<i> derives the quinone component of ubiquinone from either para-aminobenzoic acid (pABA) or 4-hydroxybenzoate (4-HB). While it is known that pABA synthesis from chorismate occurs via Abz1p and Abz2p in <i>S. cerevisiae<i>, the pathway of 4-HB synthesis is not fully characterized in this organism. It has been proposed that <i>S. cerevisiae<i> possesses a three-step pathway that converts tyrosine to 4-HB. This takes place through the following reactions: 1) deamination of tyrosine to 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate (4-HPP) by Aro8p and Aro9p, 2) conversion of 4-HPP to 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde (4-Hbz) by an unknown enzyme, and 3) oxidation of 4-Hbz to 4-HB by Hfd1p.  To synthesize CoQ6 in yeast, 4-HB is condensed with hexaprenyl-diphosphate via Coq2p to form 3-hexaprenyl-4-hydroxybenzoate. This molecule then undergoes a series of methylation, decarboxylation, and hydroxylation reactions in a pathway involving enzymes encoded by COQ genes. Of all the COQ genes known to be important for the biosynthesis of ubiquinone, several members (e.g. COQ4 and COQ9) have yet to be assigned a specific role in the pathway.

DRAP is then converted to 5-amino-6-ribitylamino-2,4-(1H,3H)-pyrimidinedione 5-phosphate in two steps: reduction of the ribosyl side chain of DRAP by Rib7p, followed by deamination of the pyrimidine ring via Rib2p. These two steps occur in the reverse order relative to the riboflavin synthesis pathway in bacteria, where deamination of DRAP precedes reduction. The product of the Rib2p reaction is then dephosphorylated and condensed via lumazine synthase (Rib4p) with 4-dihydroxy-2-butanone-4-phosphate, a metabolite of ribulose-5-phosphate. This condensation reaction results in the formation of 6,7-dimethyl-8-(1-D-ribityl)-lumazine. In the final step of the pathway, one molecule of 6,7-dimethyl-8-(1-D-ribityl)-lumazine donates a four-carbon moiety to a second molecule via riboflavin synthase (Rib5p), transforming the xylene ring of 6,7-dimethyl-8-(1-D-ribityl)-lumazine into the isoalloxazine ring of riboflavin. Riboflavin may then go on to be phosphorylated by riboflavin kinase (Fmn1p) to form FMN, and FMN itself can be converted to FAD via FAD synthetase (Fad1p).  References:	24373875|7814407	ribosyn2	OTTO

The CAR genes are activated by the globally acting transcription factors Rap1p and Abf1p , and repressed by the Ume6p-Sin2p-Rpd3p complex The presence of arginine induces CAR1 and CAR2 expression by the regulators Arg80p, Arg81p, and Mcm1p , Similarly, the presence of  proline leads to the upregulation of the proline degradation enzymes PUT1 and PUT2 by the transcription factor Put3p Also unrelated to NCR, CAR2 expression is induced by allophanate, a degradation product of urea, as well as the two positive regulators Dal181p, Dal82p	14263163|1592829|6997271|10640599|8622686|7891726|7568152|8816501|12796300|10559172|8816501|10809695|9065690|11119723|10629046|10559172	arginase degradative pathway|arginine degradation I|arginine degradation	OTTO

This pathway occurs in the mitochondrion until the final step, where the immediate precursor to valine or isoleucine is converted to its respective amino acid either in the mitochondrion (via Bat1p) or the cytosol (via Bat2p). In a branch of the common pathway, valines immediate precursor can instead be converted to -isopropylmalate via -isopropylmalate synthase (Leu4p and Leu9p), which is subsequently exported to the cytosol and metabolized to leucine in three additional steps.  Many genes in the common pathway of BCAA biosynthesis are induced by Gcn4 in response to starvation for any amino acid. Additionally, the flow of substrates into valine, isoleucine, or leucine biosynthesis is controlled depending on the concentration of each of the three amino acids. Threonine deaminase (Ilv1p), which converts threonine to -ketobutyrate for isoleucine biosynthesis, is inhibited by high concentrations of isoleucine. This inhibition is reversed by valine; however, high concentrations of both isoleucine and valine will also result in inhibition. Acetohydroxyacid synthase (AHAS; Ilv2p), which catalyzes the first step in the common pathway of BCAA biosynthesis, is subject to feedback inhibition by valine. Likewise, -isopropylmalate synthase (Leu4p and Leu9p) is also feedback inhibited by its end product, leucine.  Although fungi, eubacteria, archaebacteria, and green plants possess pathways for BCAA biosynthesis, mammals do not. Because of this, identifying inhibitors that target BCAA biosynthesis has been a subject of interest in the development of antimicrobial agents.

The biologically active form of folate is tetrahydrofolate (THF), whose metabolic derivatives serve as cofactors that carry and chemically activate one-carbon (1C) units at different levels of oxidation (methyl-THF, methylene-THF, etc.) The 1C units carried by these folate cofactors are utilized in one-carbon metabolism for the biosynthesis of various compounds including methionine, thymidylate, and purines. <i>S. cerevisiae</i> and many other microorganisms are able to synthesize tetrahydrofolate de novo, unlike humans who must acquire it from the environment.  In the folate biosynthesis pathway, chorismate is converted to p-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) and coupled to a GTP-derived pteridine moiety to form 7,8-dihydropteroate. Dihydrofolate synthetase (encoded by FOL3 in <i>S. cerevisiae<i>) subsequently adds a glutamate molecule to form 7,8-dihydrofolate, which is reduced by dihydrofolate reductase (Dfr1p) to tetrahydrofolate. Tetrahydrofolate can then be converted to one of the various 1C unit-carrying folate cofactors. Many of these cofactor forms, which differ in the position and the oxidation state of the 1C unit, mediate one-carbon transfer reactions in a specific biosynthetic pathway and can be enzymatically interconverted to one another. Furthermore, the folates produced in this pathway are subject to further glutamylation by folylpolyglutamate synthetase (Met7p), which catalyzes ATP-dependent extension of the glutamate side chain to yield folate polyglutamates. Polyglutamylation is thought to increase the affinity of intracellular folates for folate-dependent enzymes and prevent their efflux out of cells and organelles.

HOMOCYS-CYS-CONVERT	homocysteine and cysteine interconversion	STR2|STR3|CYS4|CYS3	9409150	The metabolic interconversion of cysteine and homocysteine via formation of a cystathionine intermediate is known as the transsulfuration pathway. While the transsulfuration pathway proceeds in only one direction in many bacteria and fungi, <i>S. cerevisiae</i> encodes for both a forward and reverse version of the pathway and is able to convert cysteine and homocysteine to one or the other reversibly. In the forward pathway, cysteine reacts with O-acetylhomoserine in a reaction catalyzed by cystathionine -synthase to form cystathionine. Cystathionine is then cleaved by cystathionine -lyase, yielding pyruvate, ammonia, and homocysteine. In <i>S. cerevisiae</i>, cystathionine -synthase and -lyase are thought to be encoded by STR2 and STR3 respectively, due to their similarity to the aforementioned enzymes in other organisms and the inability of str2 or str3 null mutants to utilize cysteine as a sole sulfur source. In the reverse pathway, cystathionine -synthase (Cys4p) catalyzes the condensation of homocysteine and serine to form cystathionine. Cystathionine -lyase (Cys3p) then catalyzes hydrolysis of cystathionine to produce cysteine, -ketobutyrate, and ammonia.  The presence of two transsulfuration pathways in <i>S. cerevisiae<i> enables the cell to acquire methionine from cysteine and vice-versa by using homocysteine as an intermediate. Homocysteine derived from cysteine in the forward transsulfuration pathway can be converted to methionine, while homocysteine derived from methionine can be converted to cysteine via the reverse transsulfuration pathway. This enables <i>S. cerevisiae<i> to utilize methionine or cysteine as a sole source of sulfur.  References:	9409150|10821189|14967036|24291053	transsulfuration pathway	OTTO

Because of the high abundance of xylose in wood and dry plant matter, engineering organisms for efficient fermentation of xylose to biofuel ethanol is of major industrial interest. Degradation of xylose in yeasts and filamentous fungi generally proceeds through its conversion to xylulose, phosphorylation to xylulose-5-phosphate, and subsequent metabolism in the pentose phosphate pathway. Although enzyme activities for all necessary steps in xylose utilization have been detected in <i>S. cerevisiae</i>, the conversion of xylose to xylulose does not occur in this organism at a rate sufficient for growth on xylose. As a consequence, <i>S. cerevisiae</i> can utilize xylulose but not xylose for growth and carbon in vivo.  In xylose-utilizing yeasts, conversion of xylose to xylulose occurs in two steps: reduction of xylose to xylitol by xylose reductase, and oxidation of xylitol to xylulose by xylitol dehydrogenase. In <i>S. cerevisiae<i>, the first step can be catalyzed by the unspecific aldose reductase Gre3p while the second step can be catalyzed by the xylitol dehydrogenase Xyl2p. Overexpression of both GRE3 and XYL2 enables <i>S. cerevisiae<i> to grow on xylose as the sole carbon source. Wild type <i>S. cerevisiae<i> cells accumulate xylitol when cultured on xylose, suggesting that <i>S. cerevisiae<i> metabolizes xylose to xylitol and little further in vivo. This may be due to the NAD+ requirement for xylitol dehydrogenase; NADH is thought to accumulate due to xylitol dehydrogenase activity and create a cofactor imbalance severe enough to obstruct to continuous conversion of xylitol to xylulose.

NAD also has been shown to be an important substrate in a variety of biological processes, including transcriptional regulation, DNA repair, calcium-dependent signaling pathways, calorie-restriction-mediated life-span extension and age-associated diseases NAD appears to affect these processes by regulating the Sir2p family of NAD-dependent deacetylases (Sirtuins) There are a number of pathways for NAD biosynthesis.  In yeast and most other organisms, the two major pathways are de novo synthesis of NAD (the de novo pathway) and regeneration of NAD from its nicotinamide degradation products (the NAD salvage pathway) NAD is synthesized de novo from tryptophan via kynurenine In this pathway tryptophan is converted to nicotinic acid mononucleotide (NAMN) in 6 enzymatic steps (catalyzed by Bna1-2p, and Bna4-7p) and one non-enzymatic step At NAMN the de novo pathway converges with the NAD salvage pathway and the last two steps to NAD are shared In the yeast NAD salvage pathway, the vitamin precursors nicotinamide and nicotinic acid are converted to NAMN, the point of convergence with the de novo pathway The steps from nicotinic acid to NAD were elucidated by Preiss and Handler and are sometimes referred to as the Preiss-Handler pathway Yeast can also import extracellular nicotinic acid into the cell by the permease Tna1p and then convert it into NAD via the Preiss-Handler pathway There are four additional pathways for synthesizing NAD in yeast: two salvage pathways from the vitamin precursor nicotinamide riboside (NR) and two salvage pathways from nicotinic acid riboside (NaR) Three of these salvage pathways converge first with the NAD salvage pathway and then with the de novo pathway, while the fourth, the NR salvage pathway I, is independent of both of these pathways.

TREDEG-YEAST-PWY	trehalose degradation	NTH1|ATH1	11152943	Trehalose is a storage carbohydrate that can either be synthesized or obtained from the external environment. To be utilized as a carbon source, trehalase (EC:3.2.1.28) must convert trehalose and water into two molecules of glucose . S. cerevisiae has two trehalase enzymes, one is an acid trehalase encoded by ATH1 and the other is a neutral trehalase encoded by NTH1 . The name "acid" or "neutral" are based on the optimal pH of each enzyme (pH 4.5-5.0 and pH 6.8-7.0, respectively) .   Each trehalase enzyme is active in a different subcellular location.  Nth1p occurs as homodimer that is located in the cytoplasm, and is required for the hydrolysis of intracellular trehalose . Intracellular trehalose either results from trehalose biosynthesis, or to a lesser degree from uptake of trehalose from the environment via the Mal11p transporter. Ath1p was originally predicted to be a vacuolar protein, but has been experimentally shown to mainly localize in the periplasmic space, with a small fraction also occurring in the cell wall . Extracellular trehalose is hydrolysed into 2 glucose molecules by Ath1p .	11152943|8764988|8444853|11152943|15128531|15128531|15128531	trehcat|trehalose degradation, low osmolarity|trehalose catabolism	CINDY
P4-PWY-1	superpathway of threonine and methionine biosynthesis	MET7|MET17|MET2|THR1|THR4|AAT1|AAT2|HOM3|HOM2|HOM6|MET6		The biosynthesis of threonine and methionine in <i>S. cerevisiae</i> begins in a common three-step pathway that converts aspartate to homoserine. HOM3 and HOM2, which encode the enzymes responsible for the first and second steps of this pathway respectively, are regulated by Gcn4p under the general control of amino acid biosynthesis. Additionally, threonine represses HOM3 and competitively inhibits homoserine dehydrogenase (encoded by HOM6), lending that the flow of carbon into the common pathway is primarily regulated by threonine. The Hom3p, Hom2p, and Hom6p-catalyzed reactions yield homoserine, at which point the threonine and methionine pathways diverge. Phosphorylation of homoserine by homoserine kinase (encoded by THR1) directs homoserine towards the biosynthesis of threonine, whereas acetylation by homoserine O-transacetylase (encoded by MET2) commits homoserine to the biosynthesis of sulfur amino acids.  If homoserine is phosphorylated by homoserine kinase (Thr1p), threonine synthase (Thr4p) can subsequently catalyze its conversion to threonine. THR1 and THR4 are both transcriptionally regulated by general control of amino acid biosynthesis. Like Hom3p and Hom6p, homoserine kinase is also subject to feedback inhibition by threonine.  If homoserine is acetylated by homoserine O-transacetylase (Met2p), it can enter one of two routes to be converted to homocysteine, the immediate precursor to methionine. In the first route, homocysteine is synthesized from the direct incorporation of sufide into O-acetylhomoserine via Met17p. In the second route, O-acetylhomoserine is condensed with cysteine via the transsulfuration pathway and subsequently cleaved, yielding homocysteine and pyruvate. Homocysteine can then accept a methyl group from a 1C unit-carrying derivative of tetrahydrofolate via Met6p to form methionine. When yeast cells are grown in methionine, synthesis of enzymes required for sulfate assimilation (which provides sulfide for homocysteine production) as well as methionine biosynthesis is repressed. Activation of most genes involved in the sulfur metabolic network (MET genes) requires the transcriptional activator Met4p. The activity of Met4p is regulated in response to the sulfur status of the cell, with cysteine levels serving as the major regulatory signal.  References:	22419079|9409150|5764336		CINDY

Glycerol degradation is a two-step process; the first step of glycerol phosphorylation occurs in the cytosol, then glycerol-3-phosphate enters the motichondrion where the second step of conversion to dihydroxyacetone is catalyzed Dihydroxyacetone is then returned to the cytosol where it enters into either glycolysis or gluconeogenesis. The genes encoding the enzymes catalyzing glycerol catabolism, GUT1 and GUT2, are carbon source regulated; gene expression is repressed when cells are grown on fermentable carbon sources such as glucose and upregulated on non-fermentable carbon sources such as glycerol or ethanol , , On non-fermentable carbon sources, GUT1 transcription is induced by the transcriptional activators Adr1p, Ino2p and Ino4p , while GUT2 regulation requires the protein kinase Snf1p and the transcriptional activating Hap2pHap3pHap4pHap5p complex Conversely, the negative regulator Opi1p facilitates GUT1 and GUT2 repression ,	191434|191434|10536147|11142398|10536147|11142398|10536147|11142398	aerobic glycerol catabolism|glycerol catabolism	OTTO

It is synthesized de novo in plants, eubacteria, archaea, and many fungi, but not in animals who instead must acquire it from the environment. <i>S. cerevisiae</i> is able to synthesize pantothenate de novo, however some laboratory strains still require pantothenate supplementation in order to achieve optimal growth.  Synthesis of pantothenate requires two precursors: pantoate and -alanine. The source of -alanine for this pathway varies by organism; whereas bacteria produce -alanine in one-step via the decarboxylation of aspartate, <i>S. cerevisiae<i> derives -alanine in two steps from spermine, a polyamine produced in the methionine salvage pathway. In the <i>S. cerevisiae<i> route, spermine is oxidized by amine oxidase (Fms1p) to form 3-aminopropanal, which is subsequently converted to -alanine by an aldehyde dehydrogenase (Ald2p or Ald3p). Pantoate is synthesized from 2-ketoisovalerate (2-KIV), an intermediate in the biosynthesis of branched-chain amino acids. This occurs in two steps in <i>S. cerevisiae<i>: hydroxymethylation of 2-KIV via Ecm31p to form ketopantoate, and reduction of ketopantoate to pantoate via Pan5p. After its production, pantoate can be condensed with -alanine in a reaction catalyzed by pantothenate synthetase (Pan6p) to form pantothenate. Pantothenate may then go on to react with cysteine and ATP in a five-step pathway leading up to the synthesis of coenzyme A.  References:	15565250|11154694|10373490|12586697	pantsyn	OTTO

When glucose or other preferred carbon sources are depleted, <i>S. cerevisiae</i> switches to aerobic respiration and utilizes ethanol as carbon source instead, a phenomenon known as diauxic shift. Ethanol degradation is a three-step pathway that begins with the oxidation of ethanol to acetaldehyde by alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH). Aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALD) then converts acetaldehyde to acetate, which acetyl-CoA synthetase (ACS) subsequently ligates with coenzyme A to produce acetyl-CoA.  Alcohol and aldehyde dehydrogenase each have several isozymes in <i>S. cerevisiae<i>. Of the alcohol dehydrogenases involved in catalyzing interconversion between ethanol and acetaldehyde, the cytosolic enzyme Adh2p is thought to preferentially catalyze ethanol oxidation to acetaldehyde due to its relatively low Km for ethanol. ADH2 is glucose-repressed and activated by Cat8p and Adr1p. The oxidation of acetaldehyde to acetate is catalyzed by both cytosolic and mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase, of which the main isoforms (Ald6p and Ald4p, respectively) are important for growth on ethanol.

Utilization of fructose begins with its uptake via hexose transporter (Hxt) family proteins. Of the 20 different Hxt-related proteins in <i>S. cerevisiae</i>, Hxt1p-4p, 6p, and 7p are the most important for glucose, fructose, and mannose uptake. Once inside the cell, fructose is phosphorylated to fructose-6-phosphate (F6P) by the hexokinases Hxk1p and Hxk2p. Although both kinases can catalyze this reaction, only HXK2 is expressed when fructose is the carbon source. HXK1 expression occurs in the presence of non-fermentable carbon sources or galactose. F6P, in addition to being an intermediate in glycolysis, may also be utilized in yeast to synthesize UDP-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine, a building block for major structural components of the fungal cell wall.

While xylulose is not abundant in nature, many organisms produce it as an intermediate in metabolism of xylose, the most naturally abundant sugar after glucose. In many xylose-utilizing species of yeast, degradation of xylose proceeds through its conversion to xylulose, phosphorylation to xylulose-5-phosphate, and subsequent metabolism in the pentose phosphate pathway. Although enzyme activities for all necessary steps in xylose utilization have been detected in <i>S. cerevisiae</i>, the conversion of xylose to xylulose does not occur at a rate sufficient for growth on xylose in this species. As a consequence, <i>S. cerevisiae</i> can utilize xylulose but not xylose for growth and carbon in vivo.  <i>S. cerevisiae<i> ferments xylulose at a rate ten times lower than for glucose. The rate-limiting step of xylulose utilization is catalyzed by xylulokinase (Xks1p), which phosphorylates xylulose for subsequent incorporation into the pentose phosphate pathway. XKS1 expression in <i>S. cerevisiae<i> is generally low and is not induced in the presence of xylose or xylulose. While some studies show that overexpressing XKS1 improves growth on xylulose, others report that XKS1 overexpression is toxic when cells are grown on xylulose as the sole carbon source.

It is also required for many important mannosylation reactions in the cell, including those involved in N-linked and O-linked glycosylation of proteins and synthesis of the lipid anchor glycosylphosphatidylinositol. In <i>S. cerevisiae</i>, utilization of mannose begins with its phosphorylation to mannose-6-phosphate (M6P) by hexokinase (Hxk1p or Hxk2p) or glucokinase (Glk1p). Although all three proteins can phosphorylate mannose, only HXK2 is highly expressed when yeast cells are grown on mannose as a carbon source. M6P can either be converted to GDP-mannose to support mannosylation reactions in the cell, or converted to fructose-6-phosphate (F6P) to fuel glycolysis. The conversion of M6P to F6P is reversible and catalyzed in both directions by mannose-6-phosphate isomerase (Pmi40p). When yeast cells are grown on mannose as the sole carbon source, PMI40 transcription increases 12-fold, likely in order to provide sufficient levels of F6P for glycolysis. In the absence of mannose, Pmi40p activity becomes is essential for growth, as it enables <i>S. cerevisiae</i> to synthesize M6P from glucose or other carbon sources of F6P.

YEAST-GALACT-METAB-PWY	galactose degradation	GAL1|GAL7|PGM1|PGM2|GAL10	14764091|18779058|8119301	Yeast and most other microorganisms initiate the degradation of galactose via the enzymes of the Leloir pathway, which convert galactose into glucose-6-phosphate for subsequent entry into glycolysis. In the yeast Leloir pathway, galactokinase (Gal1p) phosphorylates galactose to galactose-1-phosphate. Galactokinase is specific for the -anomer of galactose; if the galactose substrate is in the -form, then it must first be converted to the -form through the mutarotase activity of Gal10p. After its conversion to galactose-1-phosphate, galactose is subsequently swapped with a glucose moiety from UDP-glucose via Gal7p, forming UDP-galactose and glucose-1-phosphate. The glucose-1-phosphate product can then be converted to glucose-6-phosphate, a substrate of glycolysis, via phosphoglucomutase (Pgm2p or Pgm1p). On the other hand, the UDP-galactose product- which contains carbon from the original galactose substrate- can be converted to UDP-glucose via the epimerase activity of Gal10p. The glucose unit of this UDP-glucose molecule may then be converted to glucose-6-phosphate during a second round of the Leloir pathway.  In <i>S. cerevisiae<i>, the genes involved in the Leloir pathway- GAL1, GAL7, and GAL10- are transcriptionally regulated in response to galactose by Gal4p, Gal80p, and Gal3p. Gal4p functions as a transcriptional activator of GAL genes, whereas Gal80p functions to inhibit this activity by binding to Gal4p in the absence of galactose. In the presence of galactose, Gal3p binds to Gal80p in an ATP-dependent manner and relieves inhibition of Gal4p, resulting in GAL gene expression.  References:	18779058|8119301		OTTO

They are essential in all eukaryotes and likely essential in archaea, while in bacteria their requirement for growth varies. Polyamines are known to be involved in several biological processes, including post-translational modification of eIF5A in eukaryotes and biofilm formation in some bacteria. However, their role in the cell is not completely understood. The most common polyamines are putrescine, spermidine, and spermine.  In <i>S. cerevisiae<i>, the biosynthesis of putrescine, spermidine, and spermine begins with two intermediates from amino acid metabolism: ornithine, an intermediate of arginine biosynthesis and degradation, and S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet), a metabolite of methionine and a ubiquitous methyl group donor for many biological reactions. At the start of the pathway, ornithine is decarboxylated to putrescine by ornithine decarboxylase (Spe1p) while S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (Spe2p) decarboxylates AdoMet. Spermidine synthase (Spe3p) then catalyzes the transfer of an aminopropyl group from decarboxylated AdoMet to putrescine, converting the two substrates to 5-methylthioadenosine (MTA) and spermidine, respectively. In an analogous reaction, spermidine can go on to react with decarboxylated AdoMet via spermine synthase (Spe4p) to yield spermine and another molecule of MTA. Spermidine but not spermine is essential for growth in <i>S. cerevisiae<i>.  MTA, a major byproduct of the polyamine biosynthesis pathway, is also the principal substrate for the methionine salvage pathway. The methionine salvage pathway recycles MTA produced during polyamine biosynthesis or other cellular processes back into methionine. In <i>S. cerevisiae<i>, the polyamine biosynthesis pathway and the methionine salvage pathway together are estimated to account for 11-19% of the methionine used by a methionine auxotroph grown on limiting methionine.

GLYCOCAT-YEAST-PWY	glycogen catabolism	GDB1|SGA1|GPH1|PGM1|PGM2	11152943	Glycogen, a branched polymer of glucose, is a storage molecule whose accumulation is under rigorous control in many cells . Glycogen metabolism increases in response to a wide variety of environmental stresses, including heat stress or exposure to sodium chloride, hydrogen peroxide, copper sulfate, high levels of ethanol, or weak organic acids, such as sorbate or benzoate . Glycogen metabolism also increases in response to conditions of nutrient starvation, such as limited nitrogen, carbon, phosphorous, or sulfur, and during diauxic growth on glucose .  Under all of the above conditions, glycogen is degraded by Gph1p and Gdb1p enzymes, which are phosphorylase and debranching enzymes respectively .   GPH1 progressively releases glucose-1-phosphate from linear alpha (1,4)-glucosidic bonds in glycogen but is not able to break alpha (1,4)-glucosidic bonds that are close to alpha (1,6)-branch linkages . The branches are resolved by Gdb1p, which eliminates branch points in a two-step process. The first step of the process is the transfer of a maltotriosyl (or maltosyl) unit from the branch to an adjacent alpha-1,4-glucosyl chain by the oligo-1,4 to 1,4-glucanotransferase activity (EC 2.4.1.25) of Gdb1p . The second step is the subsequent hydrolysis of the residual alpha-1,6-linked glucose residue by the alpha-1,6-glucosidase activity (EC 3.2.1.33) of Gdb1p . Once the branch is resolved, Gph1p can continue glycogen degradation .  In sporulating cells, glycogen can also be degraded by Sga1p, which is a glucoamylase enzyme only expressed during late sporulation . SGA1 encodes an amylo (1,4-1,6)-glucosidase capable of degrading glycogen, starch, maltotriose, and maltose into glucose, with maximum activity against glycogen at pH 5.5 . The role of glycogen degradation during sporulation is not fully understood, since glycogen is rapidly degraded during sporulation in wild-type cells, but approximately 90% of all sga1 homozygous null mutants are able to produce viable spores .  Thus far, none of the phenotypes seen in S. cerevisiae glycogen catabolism mutants correspond to the mammalian glycogen storage diseases associated with mutations in human genes involved in glycogen catabolism .	11152943|11152943|11152943|11152943|2657401|1092346|11152943|11094287|11094287|11152943|11152943|11152943|2493265|11152943|11152943	glycogcat	OTTO

The assembly starts on the cytoplasmic side of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphate (GlcNAc-1-phosphate) is transferred from uridine 5'-diphospho-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) to dolichol-phosphate (Dol-P) followed by the addition of one N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) and five mannose residues from UDP-GlcNAc and guanosine 5'-diphosphomannose (GDP-Man), respectively.

In <i>S. cerevisiae</i>, this reaction is catalyzed by the hexokinases Hxk1p and Hxk2p and the glucokinase Glk1p. Any single one of these enzymes is sufficient for growth on glucose, however Hxk2p appears to be the main glucose-phosphorylating isoenzyme. While HXK2 is expressed in glucose, both HXK1 and GLK1 are glucose-repressed, and expression of GLK1 and HXK1 occurs at significant levels only in the presence of non-fermentable carbon sources or galactose. Hxk2p is thought to have dual functions depending on localization: cytosolic Hxk2p is a glycolytic enzyme, whereas nuclear Hxk2p is a transcriptional regulator involved in glucose-induced repression of HXK1 and GLK1 and glucose-induced expression of HXK2. In addition to glucose-mediated transcriptional regulation, the hexokinase step of glycolysis is also subject to allosteric control. Yeast hexokinase is strongly inhibited by high ATP concentrations and competitively inhibited by trehalose-6-phosphate.

This assembly is catalyzed by several groups of glycosyltransferases, each using a different nucleotide-activated or Dol-P-bound sugar as their donor substrate. One such substrate is Dol-P-glucose, which provides glucose residues for assembly of the terminal Glc3 cap on the lipid-linked oligosaccharide (LLO).  In <i>S. cerevisiae<i>, Dol-P-glucose is synthesized from glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) in three steps: conversion of G6P to glucose-1-phosphate by phosphoglucomutase (Pgm1p or Pgm2p), formation of UDP-glucose from glucose-1-phosphate and UTP via UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (Ugp1p), and transfer of glucose from UDP-glucose to Dol-P by UDP-glucose:dolichyl-phosphate glucosyltransferase (Alg5p). After its production, Dol-P-glucose may serve as substrate for the glycosyltransferases Alg6p, Alg8p, and Die2pAlg10p within the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). These enzymes catalyze the sequential addition of three glucose residues, each derived from a molecule of Dol-P-glucose, to the growing LLO during the final steps of LLO biosynthesis.

The ordered assembly of this lipid-linked oligosaccharide (LLO) begins on the cytoplasmic face of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and concludes within the lumen of the ER. Two distinct molecules provide the mannose units required for assembly of the LLO: GDP-mannose and Dol-P-mannose. GDP-mannose provides the first five mannose units attached to the LLO during the cytoplasmic phase, whereas Dol-P-mannose provides the final four units during the ER lumenal phase. In <i>S. cerevisiae</i>, Dol-P-mannose is synthesized from GDP-mannose and dolichyl phosphate (Dol-P) while GDP-mannose is synthesized from GDP and fructose-6-phosphate.  The pathway for the synthesis of GDP-mannose from fructose-6-phosphate (F6P) occurs in three steps in <i>S. cerevisiae<i>: isomerization of F6P to mannose-6-phosphate by phosphomannoisomerase (Pmi40p), conversion of mannose-6-phosphate to mannose-1-phosphate by phosphomannomutase (Sec53p), and conversion of mannose-1-phosphate and GDP to GDP-mannose via mannose-1-phosphate guanylyltransferase (Psa1p). During the cytoplasmic phase of LLO biosynthesis, GDP-mannose molecules are used by a series of glycosyltransferases (Alg1p, Alg2p, and Alg11p) to add five mannosyl residues to Dol-PP-GlcNAc2. Alternatively, GDP-mannose can donate its sugar unit to Dol-P via Dol-P-mannose synthase (Dpm1p), forming Dol-P-mannose. Molecules of Dol-P-mannose are used by a second group of glycosyltransferases (Alg3p, Alg9p, and Alg12p) during the ER lumenal phase to add the four final mannoses to Dol-PP-GlcNAc2Man5.

PWY-1801-1	formaldehyde oxidation II (glutathione-dependent)	YJL068C|SFA1|FDH1		Formaldehyde is formed by oxidative demethylation reactions in many plants and methylotrophic organisms, but Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a nonmethylotrophic yeast and cannot metabolize methanol to formaldehyde. However, S. cerevisiae is exposed to exogenous formaldehyde from plant material or in polluted air and water. Concentrations of formaldehyde of 1mM or higher are cytostatic or cytotoxic to haploid wild-type cells.  Any free formaldehyde in vivo spontaneously reacts with glutathione to form S-hydroxymethylglutathione , , The level of enzymes involved in the degradation of formaldehyde, such as Sfa1p and Yjl068p, determine the level of formaldehyde toxicity, and cells overproducing Sfa1p are resistant to formaldehyde and null mutants in either sfa1 or yjl068c are hypersensitive to formaldehyde. Sfa1p is induced in response to chemicals such as formaldehyde (FA), ethanol and methyl methanesulphonate, and Yjl068p is also induced in response to chemical stresses , , , , , , Formate dehydrogenase is encoded by FDH1YOR388C and FDH2. In some strain backgrounds of S. cerevisiae, FDH2 is encoded by a continuous open reading frame comprised of YPL275W and YPL276W.

In the first pathway, glutamate is synthesized through the reductive amination of -ketoglutarate by glutamate dehydrogenase. Two NADPH-dependent glutamate dehydrogenases exist in <i>S. cerevisiae</i>: Gdh1p and Gdh3p. GDH1 is highly expressed when either ethanol or glucose is used as the carbon source, whereas GDH3 is glucose-repressed and induced only in ethanol. The second route of glutamate biosynthesis involves the combined action of glutamine synthetase (Gln1p) and glutamate synthase (Glt1p). In the first step, glutamate reacts with a molecule of ammonia in a reaction catalyzed by Gln1p to form glutamine. In the second, glutamine reacts with -ketoglutarate via Glt1p to form two molecules of glutamate, resulting in a net gain of one for each glutamate molecule that enters the pathway.

As a primary structural element of biological membranes, phospholipids play important roles in cell morphology and organelle function. The major phospholipids found in total cell extracts from <i>S. cerevisiae</i> are phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylinositol (PI), and phosphatidylserine (PS); however, the phospholipid composition of yeast changes according to the carbon source used for growth.  All major phospholipid classes in <i>S. cerevisiae<i> may trace their synthesis to a common precursor: cytidine diphosphate diacylglycerol (CDP-DAG). CDP-DAG is synthesized in a reaction catalyzed by CDP-DAG synthase, which converts phosphatidic acid (PA) to CDP-DAG using cytidine triphosphate (CTP) as the CDP donor. There are two distinct CDP-DAG synthases in <i>S. cerevisiae<i>: Cds1p, localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and Tam41p, localized in the mitochondrial matrix. In the ER, CDP-DAG generated by Cds1p can be converted to phosphatidylinositol (PI) or phosphatidylserine (PS) via PI synthase (Pis1p) or PS synthase (Cho1p), respectively. In the mitochondrion, CDP-DAG generated by Tam41p can be sequentially converted to phosphatidylglycerol (PG), which can be further converted to cardiolipin. Synthesis of PI, PG, and cardiolipin occurs through similar mechanisms in mammalian cells; however, unlike yeast, mammals primarily synthesize PS from other phospholipids and not from CDP-DAG.  PS generated via Pis1p may undergo further processing in the mitochondria, where the enzyme PS decarboxylase (Psd1p) can convert it to phosphatidylethanolamine (PE). This represents the major route of PE synthesis in <i>S. cerevisiae<i>. The second route occurs via the CDP-ethanolamine branch of the Kennedy pathway. This pathway consists of three steps: 1) phosphorylation of ethanolamine to phosphoethanolamine by ethanolamine kinase (Eki1p) or choline kinase (Cki1p), 2) activation of phosphoethanolamine to CDP-ethanolamine by phosphoethanolamine cytidylyltransferase (Ect1p), and 3) transfer of a phosphoethanolamine moiety from CDP-ethanolamine to diacylglycerol by 1,2-diacylglycerol ethanolaminephosphotransferase (Ept1p). The other branch of the Kennedy pathway, the CDP-choline pathway, incorporates choline into phosphatidylcholine (PC) in three analogous steps. PC may also be synthesized from PE when the latter molecule undergoes three successive methylations by Cho2p and Opi3p.  References:	9885152|24520995|24866973		CINDY

They are precursors to DNA, RNA, and many important metabolites (e.g. CDP-diacylglycerol). In addition, nucleotides can be used as an energy source (primarily as ATP), signaling molecules, and cofactor components (e.g. coenzyme A).  In yeast and most eukaryotes, purine nucleotides levels are maintained via a combination of de novo synthesis and salvage pathways. The salvage pathways utilize purine bases and nucleosides taken up from the environment or formed from metabolism to synthesize purine nucleoside monophosphates. Compared to the de novo pathway, where 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate (PRPP) is converted to the adenylicguanylic nucleotide precursor inosine 5-monophosphate (IMP) over many ATP-consuming steps, the salvage pathways synthesize IMP, GMP, and AMP directly from PRPP and a purine base via the action of purine phosphoribosyltransferases.  When purines are abundant in the growth medium, the salvage pathways are the preferred routes of purine nucleotide synthesis. In <i>S. cerevisiae<i>, most of the ADE genes responsible for de novo synthesis of IMP and AMP are repressed in response to extracellular adenine, whereas extracellular guanine strongly represses the IMD genes responsible for the rate-limiting step of GMP synthesis. Adenine limitation, on the other hand, results in derepression of ADE genes and active de novo purine biosynthesis. Adenine-repressible transcriptional activation of ADE genes is mediated by the transcription factors Bas1p and Pho2p.  References:	22419079|17052198|1495962|9822821		CINDY

These reactions also catalyze the interconversion of a variety of 3, 5 and 6 carbon sugars, which is important for several biosynthetic pathways, including the biosynthesis of pyrimidines, purines, tryptophan, histidine, and aromatic amino acids The flow of glucose 6-phosphate through glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway is linked through two enzymes of the non-oxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway, transketolase (Tkl1p and Tkl2p) and transaldolase (Tal1p). The ability of these enzymes to convert one type of sugar into another allows them to convert the byproduct of one pathway into the substrate of another pathway in order to meet the metabolic needs of the cell. For example, if the cell needs ribose 5-phosphate, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate and fructose 6-phosphate will be converted to ribose 5-phosphate. If the cell needs NADPH or ATP more than ribose 5-phosphate, ribose 5-phosphate will be converted to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate and fructose 6-phosphate for use by the oxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway or glycolysis, respectively	8929392|15960801|7916691|14690456|11298766|15960801|1628611		OTTO

The methionine salvage pathway, also known as the 5-methylthioadenosine (MTA) cycle, is one such example. The MTA cycle regenerates methionine from the AdoMet metabolite 5-methylthioadenosine/MTA, which is formed predominantly as a byproduct of polyamine biosynthesis. The methionine salvage pathway is present in all types of organisms, and may have evolved to reuse sulfur after its costly assimilation into the cell.  In <i>S. cerevisiae<i>, biosynthesis of the polyamines spermidine and spermine account for over 98% of MTA produced by the cell. In the polyamine pathway, decarboxylated AdoMet (derived from methionine) is converted to MTA after losing an aminopropyl group to putrescine via spermidine synthase (Spe3p). This converts putrescine to spermidine, which can likewise react with decarboxylated AdoMet via spermine synthase (Spe4p) to form spermine and another molecule of MTA. The MTA produced by these two reactions can then enter the MTA cycle to be converted back to methionine.  References:	9409150|19946895|16530730|9073064|9573363	methylthioadenosine (MTA) cycle	CINDY

In yeast and most other organisms, the two major pathways are de novo synthesis of NAD (the de novo pathway) and regeneration of NAD from its nicotinamide degradation products (the NAD salvage pathway) NAD is synthesized de novo from tryptophan via kynurenine In this pathway tryptophan is converted to nicotinic acid mononucleotide (NAMN) in 6 enzymatic steps (catalyzed by Bna1-2p, and Bna4-7p) and one non-enzymatic step At NAMN the de novo pathway converges with the NAD salvage pathway and the last two steps to NAD are shared In the yeast NAD salvage pathway, the vitamin precursors nicotinamide and nicotinic acid are converted to NAMN, the point of convergence with the de novo pathway The steps from nicotinic acid to NAD were elucidated by Preiss and Handler and are sometimes referred to as the Preiss-Handler pathway Yeast can also import extracellular nicotinic acid into the cell by the permease Tna1p and then convert it into NAD via the Preiss-Handler pathway There are four additional pathways for synthesizing NAD in yeast: two salvage pathways from the vitamin precursor nicotinamide riboside (NR) and two salvage pathways from nicotinic acid riboside (NaR) Three of these salvage pathways converge first with the NAD salvage pathway and then with the de novo pathway, while the fourth, the NR salvage pathway I, is independent of both of these pathways.

In the initial energy investment phase, 2 molecules of ATP are consumed to convert glucose into fructose-1,6-bisphosphate. In the downstream energy producing phase, fructose-1,6-bisphosphate is then broken down into two 3-carbon sugars that are each converted into a molecule of pyruvate. 2 ATP and 1 NADH are produced for each 3-carbon sugar converted to pyruvate, therefore glycolysis nets 2 ATP, 2 NADH, and 2 pyruvate molecules for each glucose fed through the pathway.  In <i>S. cerevisiae<i>, further degradation of pyruvate can occur via respiration or fermentation. The respiration pathway involves the complete oxidation of pyruvate to CO2 via pyruvate dehydrogenase and the TCA cycle, yielding ATP and reduced cofactors (e.g. NADH) that can be oxidized in the mitochondria to produce more ATP. In the fermentation pathway, pyruvate is decarboxylated by pyruvate decarboxylase to acetaldehyde, which is then reduced to ethanol by alcohol dehydrogenase. The respiratory pathway in <i>S. cerevisiae<i> yields approximately 16 ATP per glucose, whereas the fermentation pathway results in a net gain of only two ATP per glucose. Despite the greater ATP-to-glucose ratio afforded by the respiration pathway, <i>S. cerevisiae<i> nevertheless ferments glucose in the presence of oxygen when this sugar is abundant in the growth medium. This phenomenon- the fermentation of sugar under aerobic conditions- is referred to as the Crabtree effect.  In the respiratory pathway, pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) converts pyruvate to acetyl-CoA in the mitochondrion. However, because <i>S. cerevisiae<i> is unable to transport acetyl-CoA from the mitochondrion to the cytoplasm, this organism utilizes an alternative, cytosolic pathway known as the PDH bypass to generate cytosolic acetyl-CoA from pyruvate by using acetate as an intermediate. The PDH bypass involves the concerted action of pyruvate decarboxylase, which converts pyruvate to acetaldehyde; acetaldehyde dehydrogenase, which oxidizes acetaldehyde to acetate; and acetyl-CoA synthetase, which ligates acetate with coenzyme A to form acetyl-CoA. The PDH bypass is the source of the acetate that accumulates in <i>S. cerevisiae<i> cultures when shifted from glucose limitation to glucose excess.

Acetoin production during alcoholic fermentation depends on the yeast strain and other variables such as substrate and temperature (as reported in Wine yeasts with high fermentation power generally produce low acetoin levels and large amounts of ethanol and higher alcohols (alcohols with more than 2 carbons) (as reported in	16535224|16535224	pyruvic acid fermentation to acetoin III	CINDY

In <i>S. cerevisiae</i>, de novo synthesis of PA occurs primarily through two acylation pathways: the glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P) pathway and the dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) pathway. In both routes of PA synthesis, G3P and DHAP are converted to lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and subsequently acylated to PA by 1-acyl-sn-G3P acyltransferases (Slc1p, Ale1p, and Loa1p). G3P/DHAP acyltransferases (Sct1p and Gpt2p) catalyze the first step in both pathways, acylating G3P to LPA or DHAP to 1-acyl-DHAP. Further conversion of 1-acyl-DHAP to LPA occurs via a NADPH-dependent reaction catalyzed by 1-acyl-DHAP reductase (Ayr1p). After its formation from LPA, PA can be cleaved to diacylglycerol by phosphatidate phosphatases (Pah1p, Dpp1p, Lpp1p, and App1p) for the biosynthesis of triacylglycerols. Alternatively, PA can be converted by CDP-DAG synthases (Cds1p and Tam41p) to cytidine diphosphate diacylglycerol (CDP-DAG), the precursor to all major phospholipids in <i>S. cerevisiae</i>.  The universal route of PA biosynthesis is the G3P pathway, which exists in prokaryotes, plants, yeast, and mammalian cells. In contrast, the DHAP pathway is present only in yeast and mammals. Aside from these de novo pathways, PA synthesis may also occur through alternative routes such as phosphorylation of diacylglycerol by DAG kinase (Dgk1p in yeast) and hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine by phospholipase D (Spo14p in yeast).

BIOTIN-SYNTHESIS-PWY	biotin biosynthesis	BIO4|BIO2|BIO3	12658511|18073433|16269718|10333520|8117110	Biotin (vitamin H) is an essential vitamin for all organisms. It is a cofactor for many carboxylases, including those involved in fatty acid biosynthesis, gluconeogenesis, and amino acid metabolism. The ability to synthesize biotin varies among strains of <i>S. cerevisiae</i>; many isolates, including the reference genome strain S288c, do not encode a complete biotin biosynthesis pathway and are incapable of growth in medium lacking biotin. In biotin-producing strains such as A364a, the genes involved in the full pathway have been putatively identified as BIO1 through BIO6. Strain S288c retains only BIO2 through BIO4 and is a biotin auxotroph; if both BIO1 and BIO6 are expressed in this strain, it regains biotin prototrophy.  The four steps of the biotin biosynthesis pathway have been elucidated in bacteria. First, KAPA synthase catalyzes the decarboxylative condensation of alanine and pimeloyl-CoA to form 7-keto-8-aminopelargonic acid (KAPA). Second, KAPA receives an amino group from S-adenosylmethionine via DAPA aminotransferase to form 7,8-diaminopelargonic acid (DAPA). Third, dethiobiotin synthetase catalyzes the ATP-dependent formation of dethiobiotin from DAPA and CO2. Lastly, biotin synthase inserts a sulfur atom between carbons C6 and C9 on dethiobiotin, forming biotin. The enzymes that catalyze these four reactions in <i>S. cerevisiae<i> are encoded by BIO6, BIO3, BIO4, and BIO2, respectively. Additionally, the KAPA precursor pimeloyl-CoA is presumed to be synthesized in yeast by the putative pimeloyl-CoA synthetase Bio1p.

Biologically important cyclic tetrapyrroles, such as chlorophyll, cobalamin, heme, and siroheme, coordinate a metal ion in their central cavity and function as cofactors in numerous biological processes. The iron-containing tetrapyrroles siroheme and heme function in sulfur assimilation and oxygen sensing/utilization respectively. Both are synthesized de novo via the intermediary formation of uroporphyrinogen-III in the budding yeast <i>S. cerevisiae</i>.  Like in mammals and photosynthetic bacteria, de novo synthesis of tetrapyrroles in <i>S. cerevisiae<i> begins with the condensation of glycine and succinyl-CoA to 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA). In many plants and prokaryotes however, ALA is instead synthesized from the 5-carbon chain of glutamate. After two ALA molecules are produced, they can be condensed by ALA dehydratase (Hem2p in yeast) to form porphobilinogen (PBG), the building block of tetrapyrroles. Condensation of four molecules of PBG by PBG deaminase (Hem3p) results in a linear tetrapyrrole that can be rearranged and cyclized by uroporphyrinogen-III synthase (Hem4p) to yield uroporphyrinogen-III, the major branch point intermediate between heme and siroheme biosynthesis in yeast. The fate of uroporphyrinogen-III is determined by its subsequent modification: decarboxylation of uroporphyrinogen-III commits it to the heme biosynthesis pathway, whereas methylation commits it to the biosynthesis of siroheme.

As a primary structural element of biological membranes, phospholipids play important roles in cell morphology and organelle function. The major phospholipids found in total cell extracts from <i>S. cerevisiae</i> are phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylinositol (PI), and phosphatidylserine (PS); however, the phospholipid composition of yeast changes according to the carbon source used for growth.  All major phospholipid classes in <i>S. cerevisiae<i> may trace their synthesis to a common precursor: cytidine diphosphate diacylglycerol (CDP-DAG). CDP-DAG is synthesized in a reaction catalyzed by CDP-DAG synthase, which converts phosphatidic acid (PA) to CDP-DAG using cytidine triphosphate (CTP) as the CDP donor. There are two distinct CDP-DAG synthases in <i>S. cerevisiae<i>: Cds1p, localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and Tam41p, localized in the mitochondrial matrix. In the ER, CDP-DAG generated by Cds1p can be converted to phosphatidylinositol (PI) or phosphatidylserine (PS) via PI synthase (Pis1p) or PS synthase (Cho1p), respectively. In the mitochondrion, CDP-DAG generated by Tam41p can be sequentially converted to phosphatidylglycerol (PG), which can be further converted to cardiolipin. Synthesis of PI, PG, and cardiolipin occurs through similar mechanisms in mammalian cells; however, unlike yeast, mammals primarily synthesize PS from other phospholipids and not from CDP-DAG.  PS generated via Pis1p may undergo further processing in the mitochondria, where the enzyme PS decarboxylase (Psd1p) can convert it to phosphatidylethanolamine (PE). This represents the major route of PE synthesis in <i>S. cerevisiae<i>. The second route occurs via the CDP-ethanolamine branch of the Kennedy pathway. This pathway consists of three steps: 1) phosphorylation of ethanolamine to phosphoethanolamine by ethanolamine kinase (Eki1p) or choline kinase (Cki1p), 2) activation of phosphoethanolamine to CDP-ethanolamine by phosphoethanolamine cytidylyltransferase (Ect1p), and 3) transfer of a phosphoethanolamine moiety from CDP-ethanolamine to diacylglycerol by 1,2-diacylglycerol ethanolaminephosphotransferase (Ept1p). The other branch of the Kennedy pathway, the CDP-choline pathway, incorporates choline into phosphatidylcholine (PC) in three analogous steps. PC may also be synthesized from PE when the latter molecule undergoes three successive methylations by Cho2p and Opi3p.  References:	9885152|24520995|24866973		OTTO
PWY3O-7	superpathway of threonine biosynthesis	THR1|THR4|HOM3|HOM2|HOM6|PYC2|PYC1|AAT1|AAT2	9163906|25408465|1847111|6821505	In <i>S. cerevisiae</i>, the TCA cycle intermediate oxaloacetate can be converted to threonine in six steps. In the first step, oxaloacetate receives an amino group from glutamate via aspartate aminotransferase (Aat1p/Aat2p) to form aspartate. Aspartate is then converted by aspartate kinase (Hom3p) to L-4-aspartyl phosphate, which in turn is sequentially reduced by aspartate semialdehyde dehydrogenase (Hom2p) and homoserine dehydrogenase (Hom6p) to form homoserine. Homoserine is subsequently phosphorylated by homoserine kinase (Thr1p) and finally converted to threonine via threonine synthase (Thr4p). Threonine itself, if not utilized for protein synthesis, can be further metabolized to isoleucine or cleaved to produce glycine.  Two intermediates in this pathway represent important crossroads in amino acid metabolism: aspartate and homoserine. Aspartate can be utilized for the synthesis of asparagine, arginine, and homoserine, and homoserine can be utilized for the synthesis of sulfur-containing amino acids and threonine. The flow of aspartate and homoserine into threonine biosynthesis appears to be largely modulated by threonine levels: threonine allosterically inhibits aspartate kinase (Hom3p) and competitively inhibits homoserine kinase (Thr1p). Of the two enzyme activities, aspartate kinase activity likely plays a larger role in controlling flux, as yeast strains that possess a Hom3p variant insensitive to feedback inhibition by threonine accumulate over twenty times more threonine than the wild type.  Unlike yeast, mammals lack a threonine biosynthesis pathway and must acquire threonine from the environment. To exploit this difference for medical purposes, efforts have been made to identify potential antifungal agents from compounds that inhibit the enzymes involved in threonine biosynthesis in yeast.

It occupies a central role in the metabolism of aerobic organisms, enabling the production of energy from carbohydrates, fatty acids, amino acids, and potentially any other molecule that can be converted or broken down to acetyl-CoA. In addition to its role in catabolism, the TCA cycle can also serve a biosynthetic role, as several intermediates in the pathway (e.g. oxaloacetate, succinate) provide carbon for the synthesis of amino acids or other biological compounds.  The glyoxylate cycle is similar to the TCA cycle in that both pathways share the same initial steps, namely the conversion of oxaloacetate and acetyl-CoA to the six-carbon molecule isocitrate. Here the pathways diverge- instead of catalyzing the decarboxylation of isocitrate, the glyoxylate cycle catalyzes the cleavage of isocitrate to the 4-carbon molecule succinate and the 2-carbon molecule glyoxylate. Glyoxylate is then condensed with another molecule of acetyl-CoA to form the 4-carbon molecule malate. These two steps are catalyzed by isocitrate lyase and malate synthase, respectively. Malate can then be converted back to oxaloacetate for another round through the pathway. Ultimately, the glyoxylate cycle leads to the net condensation of acetyl units into 4-carbon molecules, whereas the TCA cycle results in the net dissimilation of acetyl carbons as CO2.  The existence of both pathways in <i>S. cerevisiae<i> enables this organism to utilize acetyl units not only for energy (via the TCA cycle), but also for the synthesis of 4-carbon precursors (via the glyoxylate cycle). Consequently, <i>S. cerevisiae<i> is able to use C2 carbon sources (e.g. ethanol, acetate) and fatty acids as sole sources of carbon. The key enzymes of the glyoxylate cycle- isocitrate lyase and malate synthase- are encoded in <i>S. cerevisiae<i> by ICL1 and MLS1, respectively. Both ICL1 and MLS1 are highly induced by ethanol, acetate, and fatty acids; furthermore, disruption of either gene results in a growth defect on these carbon sources. Whereas the TCA cycle exists in virtually all aerobic organisms, the glyoxylate cycle is unique to plants, fungi, and other microorganisms such as <i>E. coli<i>.

Here, the four-carbon chain of methionine comes from aspartate, which undergoes a three-step conversion to homoserine followed by acetylation to O-acetylhomoserine. The sulfur of methionine is acquired from inorganic sulfate, which is reduced to sulfide via the sulfate assimilation pathway and incorporated into the carbon chain of O-acetyl-L-homoserine to form homocysteine. To synthesize methionine, homocysteine receives a methyl group from 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-methyl-THF) in a reaction catalyzed by methionine synthase (Met6p). 5-methyl-THF is a folate coenzyme that exists in both monoglutamated and polyglutamated forms, however only the latter can be used by Met6p as the methyl donor for this reaction.  In addition to inorganic sulfur, cysteine can also be used as a sulfur source for methionine biosynthesis in <i>S. cerevisiae<i>. This occurs through the transsulfuration pathway, where cysteine reacts with O-acetylhomoserine to form cystathionine. Cleavage of cystathionine produces homocysteine, which can undergo conversion to methionine or reverse-transsulfuration to regenerate cysteine. The transsulfuration pathway enables <i>S. cerevisiae<i> to exchange sulfur between methionine, homocysteine, and cysteine.  References:	9409150|16700064		CINDY

The biologically active form of folate is tetrahydrofolate (THF), whose metabolic derivatives serve as cofactors that carry and chemically activate one-carbon (1C) units at different levels of oxidation (methyl-THF, methylene-THF, etc.) The 1C units carried by these folate cofactors are utilized in one-carbon metabolism for the biosynthesis of various compounds including methionine, thymidylate, and purines. <i>S. cerevisiae</i> and many other microorganisms are able to synthesize tetrahydrofolate de novo, unlike humans who must acquire it from the environment.  In the folate biosynthesis pathway, dihydrofolate synthetase (Fol3p in <i>S. cerevisiae<i>) adds an initial glutamate molecule to the p-aminobenzoic acid moiety of 7,8-dihydropteroate to form 7,8-dihydrofolate. This compound is then reduced by dihydrofolate reductase (Dfr1p) to tetrahydrofolate, which can subsequently be converted to a 1C unit-carrying THF derivative. The folates produced in this pathway are subject to further glutamylation by folylpolyglutamate synthetase (Met7p), which catalyzes ATP-dependent extension of the glutamate side chain to yield folate polyglutamates. Polyglutamylation is thought to increase the affinity of intracellular folates for folate-dependent enzymes and prevent their efflux out of cells and organelles. Lending to the importance of polyglutamylation for folate coenzyme function, fol3 null mutants require folinic acid supplementation for growth and met7 null mutants are respiratory-deficient and auxotrophic for methionine.

Trehalose has also been shown to be important for surviving osmotic, ethanol, and oxidative stresses .  Trehalose biosynthesis also influences glycolysis because trehalose-6-phosphate inhibits hexokinases, which restricts the influx of sugars into glycolysis during a switch to fermentative metabolism . Trehalose biosynthesis is a two step process in which glucose 6-phosphate plus UDP-glucose is converted to alpha,alpha-trehalose 6-phosphate by trehalose-6-phosphate synthase (TPS), and then alpha,alpha-trehalose 6-phosphate and water are converted to trehalose and phosphate by trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase (TPP) . In S. cerevisiae, both of these steps occur in a single alpha,alpha-trehalose-phosphate synthase complex which is composed of four protein subunits, Tps1p , Tps2p , Tsl1p , and Tps3p . Tps1p contains the TPS catalytic activity, Tps2p contains the TPP activity, and Tps3p and Tsl1p are regulatory proteins with partially overlapping functions . Deletion of TPS1 results in loss of both TPS activity and trehalose biosynthesis while deletion of TPS2 results in loss of TPP activity. Deletion of either TSL1 or TPS3 result in mild effects, but deletion of both TSL1 and TSL3 results in significant reductions in TPS and TPP activities as well as reduced trehalose biosynthesis .	9660948|11483159|8809751|11152943|1425702|8444170|8404905|9837904|9837904|9837904	trehalose biosynthesis	OTTO

Most organisms are capable of synthesizing long chain (C12:0-C16:0) saturated fatty acids de novo.  Although the initiation and termination reactions may vary, the cyclic series of chain-lengthening reactions are essentially the same across all organisms. The fatty acid chain, which starts as a 2-carbon chain from acetyl-CoA, is extended two carbons at a time by the addition of an acetyl group from malonyl-CoA.  When the final length of the fatty acid is achieved, fatty acid synthesis is terminated.  Each cycle of chain elongation involves 5 reactions with the following enzymatic activities: malonyl transferase (EC: 2.3.1.39), ketoacyl synthase (EC: 2.3.1.41), ketoacyl reductase (EC: 1.1.1.100), 3-hydroxyacyl dehydratase (EC: 4.2.1.58, 4.2.1.59, and 4.2.1.61), and enoyl-acyl reductase (EC: 1.3.1.10). In yeast, fatty acid biosynthesis is terminated with the release of fatty acyl-CoAs from fatty acid synthase (FAS), the enzyme complex that carries out de novo fatty acid biosynthesis.  Palmitoyl- (C16) and stearoyl-CoA (C18) are the main products in yeast, while myristoyl-CoA (C14) is only produced in small amounts To synthesize palmitoyl-CoA (C16) one acetyl-CoA and 7 malonyl-CoA molecules are required.  The elongation substrate, malonyl-CoA is synthesized from the carboxylation of acetyl-CoA (EC 6.4.1.2) by the biotin-containing enzyme, acetyl-CoA carboxylase (Acc1p) Acetyl-CoA carboxylase is activated by the biotin:apoprotein ligase (Bpl1p) There are two types of FAS systems based on the organization of the catalytic sites. Fungi, animals, and some bacteria have type I FASs, which are large multi-functional proteins that contain all of the requisite catalytic active sites for fatty acid biosynthesis within domains on a single polypeptide (alpha) or on two polypeptides (alpha and beta). Fungal FASs are alpha6beta6 heterododecamers, animal FASs are alpha2 homodimers, and some type I bacterial FASs are alpha6 Bacteria, plants and mitochondria, on the other hand, have type II FAS systems, which are comprised of independent proteins, whereby each protein catalyzes a single step in the cyclic series of reactions The yeast FAS complex catalyzes a total of 8 reactions. The alpha subunit(Fas2p) catalyzes 3 reactions, ketoacyl synthase (EC: 2.3.1.41),ketoacyl reductase (EC: 1.1.1.100) and self pantetheinylation and the yeast beta subunit (Fas1p) catalyzes 5 reactions, acetyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.38), malonyl transferase (EC: 2.3.1.39),3-hydroxyacyl dehydratase (EC: 4.2.1.58, 4.2.1.59, and 4.2.1.61),enoyl-acyl reductase (EC: 1.3.1.10), and palmitoyl transferase (EC:2.3.1.-) FASs are regulated at the transcriptional and translational level as well as posttranslationally.  In yeast, FAS is a housekeeping enzyme that is expressed constitutively at a low level, but its expression is also activated by the general yeast transcription factors Rap1, Abf1 and Reb1 and theinositolcholine-responsive transcription factor heterodimer, Ino2p-Ino4p The coordinate expression of the two subunits also appears to be regulated by Fas1p controlling the expression of FAS2 The FAS subunits are further regulated by proteolytic degradation of excess subunits.

In yeast, fatty acid biosynthesis is terminated with the release of fatty acyl-CoAs from fatty acid synthase (FAS), the enzyme complex that carries out de novo fatty acid biosynthesis.  Palmitoyl- (C16) and stearoyl-CoA (C18) are the main products in yeast, while myristoyl-CoA (C14) is only produced in small amounts To synthesize palmitoyl-CoA (C16) one acetyl-CoA and 7 malonyl-CoA molecules are required.  The elongation substrate, malonyl-CoA is synthesized from the carboxylation of acetyl-CoA (EC 6.4.1.2) by the biotin-containing enzyme, acetyl-CoA carboxylase (Acc1p) Acetyl-CoA carboxylase is activated by the biotin:apoprotein ligase (Bpl1p) There are two types of FAS systems based on the organization of the catalytic sites. Fungi, animals, and some bacteria have type I FASs, which are large multi-functional proteins that contain all of the requisite catalytic active sites for fatty acid biosynthesis within domains on a single polypeptide (alpha) or on two polypeptides (alpha and beta). Fungal FASs are alpha6beta6 heterododecamers, animal FASs are alpha2 homodimers, and some type I bacterial FASs are alpha6 Bacteria, plants and mitochondria, on the other hand, have type II FAS systems, which are comprised of independent proteins, whereby each protein catalyzes a single step in the cyclic series of reactions The yeast FAS complex catalyzes a total of 8 reactions. The alpha subunit(Fas2p) catalyzes 3 reactions, ketoacyl synthase (EC: 2.3.1.41),ketoacyl reductase (EC: 1.1.1.100) and self pantetheinylation and the yeast beta subunit (Fas1p) catalyzes 5 reactions, acetyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.38), malonyl transferase (EC: 2.3.1.39),3-hydroxyacyl dehydratase (EC: 4.2.1.58, 4.2.1.59, and 4.2.1.61),enoyl-acyl reductase (EC: 1.3.1.10), and palmitoyl transferase (EC:2.3.1.-) FASs are regulated at the transcriptional and translational level as well as posttranslationally.  In yeast, FAS is a housekeeping enzyme that is expressed constitutively at a low level, but its expression is also activated by the general yeast transcription factors Rap1, Abf1 and Reb1 and theinositolcholine-responsive transcription factor heterodimer, Ino2p-Ino4p The coordinate expression of the two subunits also appears to be regulated by Fas1p controlling the expression of FAS2 The FAS subunits are further regulated by proteolytic degradation of excess subunits. While the intact FAS multimeric complex (alpha6beta6 ) is stable, its individual subunits are rapidly degraded	1350093|7649444|17448991|15952903|365179|1100391|10785388|3528750|374077|7925441|1461729|7862526|11713312|1735446|8262967		CINDY

The major bioactive form of thiamin, thiamin diphosphate (TDP), is a cofactor for many enzymes involved in carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism. Bacteria, plants, and fungi are able to synthesize thiamin de novo, while animals must acquire it from the environment. Thiamin is formed from the ring structures of two aromatic compounds: 4-amino-5-hydroxymethyl-2-methylpyrimidine diphosphate (HMP-PP) and 5-(2-hydroxyethyl)-4-methylthiazole phosphate (HET-P). In <i>S. cerevisiae</i>, thiamin diphosphate is synthesized from HMP-PP and HET-P in three steps. First, HMP-PP and HET-P are condensed by Thi6p to yield thiamin monophosphate (TMP). Second, TMP is dephosphorylated to yield thiamine. This step is presumed to be catalyzed by nonspecific phosphatases in the cytosol. Third, thiamine is pyrophosphorylated by thiamin pyrophosphokinase (Thi80p) to yield TDP.  The thiazole and pyrimidine heterocycles of thiamin are derived from HET-P and HMP-PP, respectively. The underlying mechanisms for the synthesis of the thiazole and pyrimidine precursors in yeast are not yet fully understood. In <i>S. cerevisiae<i>, the thiazole is formed from NAD, glycine, and a cysteine residue from the active site of thiazole synthase (Thi4p). This unusual suicide mechanism results in a single turnover capacity for Thi4p. Likewise, the pyrimidine ring is formed from histidine and pyridoxal phosphate via the action of THI5 family enzymes, and may also involve a suicide mechanism where histidine is supplied from the active site of Thi5p. The single turnover capacity of Thi4p and Thi5p is speculated to balance the provision of thiazole and pyramidine heterocycles and provide an alternate regulatory mechanism for thiamin biosynthesis in yeast (see References:	23048037|18161008|17309261|22031445|22568620|23048037	vitamin B1 biosynthesis|thiamin biosynthesis	CINDY

It is synthesized in a reaction catalyzed by CDP-DAG synthase, which converts phosphatidic acid (PA) to CDP-DAG using cytidine triphosphate (CTP) as the CDP donor. There are two distinct CDP-DAG synthases in <i>S. cerevisiae</i>: Cds1p, localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and Tam41p, localized in the mitochondrial matrix. Both localizations represent the site of action for the CDP-DAG pathway of phospholipid biosynthesis in yeast. At the ER site, CDP-DAG generated by Cds1p can be converted to phosphatidylinositol (PI) or phosphatidylserine (PS) via PI synthase (Pis1p) and PS synthase (Cho1p), respectively. At the mitochondrial site, CDP-DAG generated by Tam41p can be sequentially converted to phosphatidylglycerol (PG) and further converted to cardiolipin. Synthesis of PI, PG, and cardiolipin occurs through similar mechanisms in mammalian cells; however, unlike yeast, mammals primarily synthesize PS from other phospholipids and not from CDP-DAG.

Expression of the genes involved in the latter pathway decreases upon depletion of glucose. When ethanol or other non-fermentable substrates are used as the carbon source, <i>S. cerevisiae</i> can alternatively synthesize glycine from glyoxylate via alanine glyoxylate aminotransferase (Agx1p). Glycine and serine produced in these pathways can be interconverted to one another via the tetrahydrofolate-dependent serine hydroxymethyltransferases Shm1p and Shm2p. Between these, the cytoplasmic isoform Shm2p serves as the major source of glycine (via serine breakdown) in serine-rich conditions. The mitochondrial isoform Shm1p may also contribute to glycine synthesis, however it preferentially catalyzes serine synthesis from glycine under conditions of serine starvation.

Biologically important cyclic tetrapyrroles, such as chlorophyll, cobalamin, heme, and siroheme, coordinate a metal ion in their central cavity and function as cofactors in numerous biological processes. Heme, which coordinates an iron atom, functions in oxygen sensing and utilization.  To synthesize heme and other tetrapyrrole-derived compounds, <i>S. cerevisiae<i> utilizes a common biosynthetic pathway that leads up to the formation of the first macrocyclic intermediate, uroporphyrinogen-III, upon which the pathways diverge. In the heme biosynthetic route, four carboxyl groups are removed sequentially from the acetate side chains of uroporphyrinogen-III by uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase (Hem12p) to form coproporphyrinogen III. Decarboxylation of two of the carboxyethyl side chains of coproporphyrinogen III by coproporphyrinogen III oxidase (Hem13p) then forms protoporphyrinogen IX, which is subsequently oxidized by protoporphyrinogen oxidase (Hem14p) to yield protoporphyrin IX. In the final step, a ferrous ion is inserted into protoporphyrin IX by ferrochelatase (Hem15p), forming the end-product heme.  References:	11212295|2180703|2838478|7798202|2185242		EURIE

UDP-GlcNAc also provides GlcNAc moieties for N-linked glycosylation of proteins and for the biosynthesis of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI), a lipid anchor involved in tethering proteins to the cell membrane. Synthesis of UDP-GlcNAc is an essential process in <i>S. cerevisiae</i>; conditional depletion of several of the enzymes in the pathway (Gna1p, Pcm1p, Qri1p) results in aberrant cell morphology and increased cell lysis.  In <i>S. cerevisiae<i>, UDP-GlcNAc is synthesized in four steps from fructose-6-phosphate (F6P). First, F6P is converted to glucosamine-6-phosphate (GlcN6P) by glutamine:fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase (GFAT). Second, GlcN6P is N-acetylated by GlcN6P acetyltransferase (Gna1p). This forms GlcNAc-6-P, which in the third step of the pathway is isomerized to GlcNAc-1-P by phosphoacetylglucosamine mutase (Pcm1p). Finally, GlcNAc-1-P is condensed with UTP via UDP-GlcNAc pyrophosphorylase (Qri1p), yielding UDP-GlcNAc. The UDP-GlcNAc biosynthesis pathway described in yeast occurs similarly in other eukaryotes, however in the bacterial pathway GlcN-6-P is initially isomerized to GlcN-1-P prior to N-acetylation.

In all cellular organisms, synthesis of the four canonical dNTPs (dATP, dGTP, dCTP, dTTP) required for DNA replication and repair involves the action of ribonucleotide reductase, which converts ribonucleotides to their corresponding deoxy- forms by substituting their 2-hydroxyl group with a hydrogen atom. <i>S. cerevisiae</i> contains a class Ia RNR that is composed of two large and two small subunits. RNR2 and RNR4 encode the small subunits, while the large subunits are encoded by either RNR1 (major isoform) or RNR3 (minor isoform). Budding yeast RNR accepts ribonucleoside diphosphates (e.g. ADP, UDP) as substrate and converts them to their corresponding deoxy- forms (e.g. dADP, dUDP). These dNDPs can then be phosphorylated by NDP kinase (Ynk1p) to yield dNTPs. In contrast to the class I RNRs in yeast and other eukaryotes, class II and class III RNRs found in archaea and many bacteria can produce dNTPs directly by using NTPs as substrates.  In <i>S. cerevisiae<i>, the only dNDP that cannot be synthesized directly by RNR is dTDP. Synthesis of thymine-containing nucleotides requires dUMP, which can be formed via the removal of pyrophosphate from dUTP by dUTP pyrophosphatase (Dut1p). dTMP is synthesized from dUMP when the latter molecule receives a methyl group from 5,10-methylene-tetrahydrofolate via thymidylate synthase (Cdc21p). The subsequent phosphorylation of dTMP by thymidylate kinase (Cdc8p) yields dTDP, which can be phosphorylated once more by Ynk1p to yield the end product dTTP.

Saccharomyces cerevisiae contains three enzymes (Urk1p, Urh1p, and Cdd1p) that are able to salvage deoxycytidine in vitro . However of these three enzymes, only Urk1p and Urh1p have been shown to metabolize deoxycytidine in vivo . In vitro Cdd1p has been shown to deaminate deoxycytidine to form deoxyuridine, however the biological significance of this is doubtful . Evidence that Cdd1p is not important for deoxypyrimidine salvage comes from the observation that fyc1 urh1 urk1 triple mutants are resistant to 5-fluorodeoxycytidine, indicating that these cells are not able to metabolize deoxycytidine .

They are precursors to DNA, RNA, and many important metabolites (e.g. CDP-diacylglycerol). In addition, nucleotides can be used as an energy source (primarily as ATP), signaling molecules, and cofactor components (e.g. coenzyme A).  De novo purine nucleotide biosynthesis in yeast involves the 10-step production of the purine nucleotide inosine monophosphate (IMP), the common precursor to both adenosine monophosphate (AMP) and guanosine monophosphate (GMP). Synthesis of IMP begins with a reaction catalyzed by amidophosphoribosyltransferase (Ade4p) between PRPP (5-phosphoribosylpyrophosphate), glutamine, and water. Glutamine displaces the pyrophosphate group of PRPP, converting PRPP to phosphoribosylamine. The amino group of phosphoribosylamine subsequently reacts with a carboxyl group of glycine via Ade5,7p, forming the amide bond of phosphoribosylglycinamide. In the third reaction of the pathway, a tetrahydrofolate cofactor donates a one-carbon unit at the oxidation level of formate to the -amino group of phosphoribosylglycinamide. This forms phosphoribosyl-N-formylglycinamide, which reacts with an amino group from glutamine via Ade6p to form phosphoribosylformylglycinamidine. In three ATP-dependent steps, this product then undergoes closure of the imidazole ring by Ade5,7p, carboxylation by Ade2p, and condensation with aspartate by Ade1p. Adenylosuccinate lyase (Ade13p) subsequently catalyzes cleavage with release of fumarate to form aminoimidazole carboxamide ribonucleotide (AICAR). In the final two steps, Ade16p or Ade17p introduce a formyl group to the amino group on the imidazole ring, then condense the formyl carbon with the nitrogen from the amide group. This results in closure of the 6-membered ring and yields the purine nucleotide IMP.  The incorporation of an aspartate group to IMP, followed by cleavage with the loss of fumarate, results in the conversion IMP to AMP. These reactions are catalyzed by adenylosuccinate synthetase (Ade12p) and adenylosuccinate lyase (Ade13p), respectively. Oxidation of IMP, on the other hand, converts it to xanthosine monophosphate (XMP). XMP can be amidated (using glutamine as the donor) to form GMP in a reaction catalyzed by GMP synthase (Gua1p).

They are precursors to DNA, RNA, and many important metabolites (e.g. CDP-diacylglycerol). In addition, nucleotides can be used as an energy source (primarily as ATP), signaling molecules, and cofactor components (e.g. coenzyme A).  In <i>S. cerevisiae<i>, the initial steps of de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis are catalyzed by the bifunctional carbamoylphosphate synthetaseaspartate transcarbamylase Ura2p. In the first step, Ura2p catalyzes the synthesis of carbamoylphosphate from CO2, ATP, and glutamine. In the second, Ura2p condenses carbamoylphosphate with aspartate to yield ureidosuccinatecarbamoyl-L-aspartate. Third, dihydroorotase (Ura4p) catalyzes closure of the pyrimidine ring of ureidosuccinate to form dihydroorotate (DHO). DHO, in turn, is oxidized to orotic acid (OA), condensed with phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate to form orotidine 5-monophosphate, and finally decarboxylated to yield UMP. These three steps are catalyzed by Ura1p, Ura5pUra10p, and Ura3p, respectively. UMP may then undergo further processing to form other pyrimidines.  The de novo pyrimidine pathway is regulated at both the enzymatic and transcriptional levels. Ura2p, which catalyzes the first committed step of the pathway, is subject to end product feedback inhibition by UTP. Transcription of URA2 is repressed by UTP and uracil. Furthermore, transcription of URA2 and several other genes in the pathway is upregulated in response to pyrimidine starvation. Upregulation of URA1, URA3, and URA4 during pyrimidine starvation depends upon the zinc finger transcription factor Ppr1p. Two intermediates in the pyrimidine pathway regulate the transcriptional activity of Ppr1p: DHO and OA. At low concentrations, these intermediates convert Ppr1p into its active state, resulting in transcription of URA genes. High concentrations of DHO and OA, however, inhibit Ppr1p activity in vitro.

If the required substrates are available, salvage pathways are preferred over de novo synthesis pathways for pyrimidine biosynthesis .  The salvage pathways of pyrimidine ribonucleotides consist of 1) importing exogenous bases into the cell, and 2) the interconversion of various bases . Three proteins are involved in the import of exogenous bases used by the salvage pathway for pyrimidine ribonucleotide biosynthesis.

Compared to the de novo pathway, where 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate (PRPP) is converted to the adenylic/guanylic nucleotide precursor inosine 5-monophosphate (IMP) over many ATP-consuming steps, the salvage pathways synthesize IMP, GMP, and AMP directly from PRPP and a purine base via the action of purine phosphoribosyltransferases. There are three main phosphoribosyltransferases involved in purine salvage in <i>S. cerevisiae</i>: i) Hpt1p, which produces GMP and IMP from guanine and hypoxanthine, respectively; ii) Apt1p, which synthesizes AMP from adenine; and iii) Xpt1p, which synthesizes XMP from xanthine.

In the salvage pathway for guanine, guanine is converted to guanosine monophosphate (GMP) by hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT). Alternatively, guanine can be converted to xanthine by guanine deaminase. In <i>S. cerevisiae</i>, these enzymes are encoded by HPT1 and GUD1, respectively. Xanthine itself can be salvaged to form XMP by xanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (Xpt1p in yeast) and further converted to GMP by GMP synthase (Gua1p). <i>S. cerevisiae</i> mutants defective in the de novo GMP biosynthesis pathway are viable when supplied with guanine, demonstrating that the salvage pathway can act as a sufficient source of guanylic nucleotides in this organism.  Because overproduction or starvation of purine nucleotides is deleterious to cells, the intracellular pool of these compounds must be carefully balanced. Purine salvage appears to be an important factor in this regard. Deletion of HPT1 in <i>S. cerevisiae<i> leads to de-repression of enzymes involved in the de novo pathway, resulting in constitutively active purine nucleotide biosynthesis. On the other hand, overexpression of feedback-insensitive mutant hpt1 in the presence of guanine leads to guanylic nucleotide overaccumulation and massive cell death. Notably, deficiency of HPRT activity in humans results in increased production of purine nucleotides and is also regarded as the cause of Lesch-Nyhan syndrome.

Serine is also the primary source of one-carbon units in folate-mediated one-carbon metabolism, a network of carbon transfer reactions required for the biosynthesis of methionine, thymidylate, and purines. <i>S. cerevisiae</i> possesses three major pathways for serine biosynthesis: a phosphoglycerate pathway that synthesizes serine from 3-phosphoglycerate, a threonine pathway that synthesizes serine from threonine-derived glycine, and a glyoxylate pathway that synthesizes serine from glyoxylate-derived glycine. The former two pathways operate when glucose is the carbon source while the latter pathway operates during growth on non-fermentable substrates.  In the glyoxylate pathway, glyoxylate is converted to glycine via alanine:glyoxylate aminotransferase (Agx1p). Glycine is then converted to serine via serine hydroxymethyltransferase (Shm1pShm2p). The reaction catalyzed by serine hydroxymethyltransferase is reversible; however the cytoplasmic isoform (SHM2) is thought to contribute more to serine catabolism while the mitochondrial isoform (SHM1) contributes to serine synthesis. The roles of SHM1 and SHM2 are reported to change in accordance to the nutritional requirements of the cell, particularly to the availability of serine or glycine.

The methionine salvage pathway, also known as the 5-methylthioadenosine (MTA) cycle, is one such example. The MTA cycle regenerates methionine from the AdoMet metabolite 5-methylthioadenosine/MTA, which is formed predominantly as a byproduct of polyamine biosynthesis. The methionine salvage pathway is present in all types of organisms, and may have evolved to reuse sulfur after its costly assimilation into the cell.  In the MTA cycle, four carbon atoms from the ribose moiety (C-2 through C-5) of MTA give rise to the carbon skeleton of methionine while the methylthiol group is conserved. The preferred amino group donor for the transamination reaction at the final step of pathway varies by organism; in <i>S. cerevisiae<i>, branched-chain and aromatic amino acids are both preferred donors. This step occurs via the branched-chain transaminases Bat1p and Bat2p or the aromatic amino acid transaminases Aro8p and Aro9p. The less-used donors for this reaction in <i>S. cerevisiae<i> are lysine, proline, glutamate, and glutamine. In addition to methionine, the MTA cycle may also serve as a source of purines, as adenine is cleaved off from MTA during the first reaction of the cycle.

PWY3O-238	methionine biosynthesis	MET6|MET7	1789001|10799479|9409150|16700064	<i>S. cerevisiae</i> synthesizes methionine via the methylation of homocysteine. In this reaction, the cobalamin-independent methionine synthase Met6p catalyzes the transfer of a methyl group from 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-methyl-THF) to the thiol of homocysteine, forming methionine. 5-methyl-THF is a folate coenzyme that carries a single-carbon unit originating from one-carbon metabolism. It exists in both monoglutamated and polyglutamated forms, however only the latter can be used by Met6p as the methyl donor for this reaction. Yeast cells defective in polyglutamylation of folate coenzymes (MET7 null mutants) are auxotrophic for methionine.  The other component of this reaction, homocysteine, is derived from aspartate and sulfur. In <i>S. cerevisiae<i>, aspartate can be utilized for homocysteine biosynthesis by undergoing a three-step conversion to homoserine followed by acetylation to O-acetylhomoserine. O-acetylhomoserine can then react with sulfide to produce homocysteine directly, or it can react with cysteine (a sulfur amino acid) to produce cystathionine via the transsulfuration pathway. The subsequent cleavage of cystathionine produces homocysteine.  References:	9409150|16700064|10799479		CINDY

ARG-PRO-PWY	L-arginine degradation VI (arginase 2 pathway)	PRO3|CAR2|CAR1	12620851	Under conditions where optimal sources of nitrogen are unavailable, S. cerevisiae is able to utilize arginine as its sole nitrogen source. Arginine catabolism occurs in the cytosol with the hydrolysis of arginine to proline, releasing three nitrogen atoms that can be used by the cell , In the absence of oxygen, the proline ring is unable to be further degraded The utilization of arginine as a nitrogen source is repressed if better nitrogen compounds such as ammonia, asparagine or glutamine are present. This is known as nitrogen catabolite repression (NCR) The CAR1 gene is subject to the effect of this repression which is mediated by the negative regulator Ure2p , In the presence of arginine and the absence of a preferred nitrogen source, NCR is released by the GATA transcriptional activators Gln3p and Gat1p , , Unrelated to NCR, the presence of arginine also induces CAR1 and CAR2 expression by the regulators Arg80p, Arg81p and Mcm1p , The CAR genes are also activated by the globally acting transcription factors Rap1p and Abf1p , Conversely, CAR1 and CAR2 experssion is repressed by the Ume6p-Sin2p-Rpd3p complex Additionally, CAR2 expression is unduced by the two positive regulators Dal81p and Dal82p as well as allophanate, a degradation product of urea Wild type S. cerevisiae cells normally synthesize proline by a pathway involving the gene products of PRO1, PRO2, and PRO3. However, strains that are mutant for pro1 and pro2 are able to bypass the early steps of proline biosynthesis and satisfy their requirement for proline via the arginine degradation pathway.

The enzymes that catalyze the second and third steps are encoded by a single gene (ARG5,6) that is translated into a pre-protein which is imported into mitochondria and cleaved there to yield two enzymes, N-acetylglutamate kinase and N-acetylglutamyl-phosphate reductase These enzymes form a complex with each other and with N-acetylglutamate synthase, the first enzyme in the pathway, which may have implications for regulation of their activity The mitochondrial steps of the arginine biosynthesis pathway result in the formation of ornithine, which is exported to the cytoplasm by the transporter Ort1p In the cytoplasm, L-ornithine is converted to L-arginine in three reactions mediated by ornithine carbamoyltransferase, arginosuccinate synthase, and argininosuccinate lyase.  Transcription of genes of the arginine biosynthetic pathway, as well as of other amino acid biosynthetic pathways, is activated by the transcription factor Gcn4p under conditions of amino acid starvation Transcription of ARG1, ARG3, ARG5,6, and ARG8 is also repressed in the presence of arginine by the ArgR/Mcm1p complex, which consists of Arg80p, Arg81p, Arg82p, and Mcm1p The transcriptional activator Gcn4p interacts with subunits of the ArgR/Mcm1p repressor, allowing for fine-tuning of transcriptional control in response to arginine availability General Background (from MetaCyc)  Arginine biosynthesis is notable for its complexity and variability at the genetic level, and by its connection with several other pathways, such as pyrimidine and polyamine biosynthesis, and certain degradative pathways. The initial steps of the arginine biosynthetic pathways proceed via N-acetylated intermediates. The presumed reason for this is that the acetylation prevents the spontaneous cyclization of glutamate derivatives, which leads to proline biosynthesis, thus keeping the two pathways separate ( and references therein).  About This Pathway (from MetaCyc)  The cyclic pathway for arginine biosynthesis has been demonstrated in many organisms, including the prokaryotes Bacillaceae, pseudomonads, cyanobacteria, photosynthetic bacteria and archaebacteria, as well as eukaryotic organisms such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Neurospora sp., and Chlamydomonas sp.  Organisms that employ this pathway possess the argJ gene, which encodes the enzyme ornithine acetyltransferase (OAT). OAT catalyzes the transfer of the acetyl group from N--acetyl-ornithine to glutamate, generating ornithine and N-acetyl-glutamate (NAG). Since the later is the substrate for another enzyme in this pathway, N-acetyl-glutamate kinase (encoded by argB), which catalyzes a previous step, this reaction effectively converts the otherwise linear pathway to a cyclical pathway While most of the NAG in these organisms is generated by OAT, some of it is still generated by N-acetyl-ornithine synthase (NAGS, EC 2.3.1.1, encoded by argA), which fulfils an anaplerotic (replenishment of pathway intermediates) role to replenish NAG that is lost due to degradation or cell division In some bacteria, such as Bacillus sp. , Nisseria gonorrhoeae , Thermotoga neapolitana and in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) , OAT can have a dual enzymic function. In these organisms, either N-acetylornithine or acetyl-CoA can be used as acetyl donors for formation of NAG. argJ genes from such organisms can complement both argE and argA mutations in E. coli. However, these organisms still possess separate NAGS enzymes encoded by argA genes. The biological role of duplicate NAGS activity in these organisms remains to be elucidated	11553611|1649049|11553611|8798783|11390663|14563547|15289616|12633501|8025667|12633501|8473852|1339419|10931207|9428669|12633501		CINDY

Catabolism of asparagine for nitrogen involves the action of asparaginases, which hydrolyze the amide group in the side chain of asparagine. This converts asparagine to aspartate and releases an assimilable molecule of ammonia. Further nitrogen can be derived from the newly generated aspartate molecule via its reversible conversion to glutamate by aspartate aminotransferases.

It is also involved in the biosynthesis of glutathione, a tripeptide that acts as a cellular redox buffer.  <i>S. cerevisiae<i> synthesizes cysteine through the reverse transsulfuration pathway, which converts homocysteine to cysteine via the formation of a cystathionine intermediate. This takes place over two steps: In the first, cystathionine -synthase (Cys4p) catalyzes a -displacement reaction where the thiol group of homocysteine displaces the hydroxyl group of serine to produce cystathionine. In the second, cystathionine -lyase (Cys3p) catalyzes an ,-elimination reaction where cystathionine is hydrolyzed to produce cysteine, -ketobutyrate, and ammonia.

The main pathway for S. cerevisiae glutamate degradation is catalyzed by the NAD dependent glutamate dehydrogenase encoded by GDH2 Transcriptional regulation of GDH2 is dependent upon six different sequence elements present in the promoter Two elements behave as upstream activation sites (UAS) while the remaining four sites inhibit the effects of the two UASs One UAS has been shown to activate transcription during growth on nonfermentable carbon sources or on limiting amounts of glucose The other UAS is under the control of nitrogen catabolite repression (NCR) Under nitrogen-poor conditions, GDH2 expression is upregulated by the transcriptional activator Gln3p and the co-activator Hfi1p , , Conversely, in the presence of an optimal nitrogen source such as glutamine, GDH2 transcription is repressed by the transcription factor Ure2p Unrelated to NCR, GDH2 gene expression is regulated by ammonia concentrations. An increase in intracellular ammonia leads to a decrease in GDH2 expression but an increase in extracellular ammonia leads to an increase in GDH2 transcription and Gdh2p activity Gdh2p enzyme activity also appears to be regulated by phosphorylation through cAMP-dependent and cAMP-independent protein kinases and subsequent proteolysis ,	1975578|1975578|1682801|1652057|1652057|4394512|1990286|8416910|10048020|1990286|12851403|7592450|6319381|7009211		OTTO

LIPASYN-PWY-1	phospholipids degradation	PLC1|ISC1|SPO14		In addition to being a primary structural components of cell membranes, phospholipids may also be thought of as a reservoir of signaling molecules. Hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate (PIP2) by phospholipase C, for instance, generates the signaling molecules inositol triphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG). <i>S. cerevisiae</i> catalyzes this reaction via Plc1p, a phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C involved in a variety of biological processes including nutrient sensing and filamentous growth. On the other hand, degradation of phosphatidylcholine (PC) by phospholipase D (Spo14p) yields phosphatidic acid and choline; this activity generates PA required for sporulation in <i>S. cerevisiae</i>. A phospholipase C specific for PC has yet to be identified in <i>S. cerevisiae</i>, however PC may also serve as substrate for phospholipases B (Plb1-3p and Nte1p), which hydrolyze PC to yield glycerophosphocholine (GPC) and two fatty acids. Both phospholipases B and D are thought to mediate PC turnover in yeast, and phospholipase B (as Plb1p) has also been implicated in acyl chain remodeling.

The -oxidation cycle catalyzes the complete oxidation of a fatty acid molecule, removing two carbon atoms (in the form of acetyl-CoA) with each turn of the cycle. The subcellular location in which -oxidation occurs varies by organism; in bacteria, -oxidation occurs in the cytoplasm, whereas in mammalian cells it occurs in both the mitochondria and the peroxisome. In contrast, -oxidation in <i>S. cerevisiae</i>, plants, and most other fungi occurs exclusively in the peroxisome.  -oxidation begins with the activation of a fatty acid with coenzyme A, producing an acyl-CoA. In <i>S. cerevisiae<i>, the uptake of free fatty acids as well as their activation with coenzyme A occurs via the acyl-CoA synthases Fat1p and Faa1p-Faa4p. The acyl-CoA molecule is then oxidized, introducing a double bond between C2 (the -carbon) and C3 (the -carbon). This step is catalyzed by acyl-CoA oxidase, encoded by POX1 in yeast. In the third step, the double bond is hydrated, leading to the formation of a hydroxyl group on C3. The stereochemistry of the 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA intermediate is specific to the type of -oxidation pathway. In fungal peroxisomes, -oxidation proceeds via (3R)-hydroxy intermediates; in contrast, mitochondrial -oxidation in mammals proceeds via the (3S) enantiomer. In the fourth step, the hydroxyl group is oxidized to a carbonyl group, forming a 3-ketoacyl-CoA intermediate. Steps 3-4 are both catalyzed by the multifunctional enzyme Fox2p in <i>S. cerevisiae<i>. Lastly, the 3-ketoacyl-CoA intermediate undergoes thiolytic cleavage between C2 and C3, yielding one acetyl-CoA and an acyl-CoA molecule shortened by two carbon atoms. This step is catalyzed by 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase, encoded by POT1 in <i>S. cerevisiae<i>.

It is the third most abundant phospholipid found in the membranes of <i>S. cerevisiae</i> and a precursor to phosphoinositides, inositol polyphosphates, and complex sphingolipids. PI and its metabolites are involved in a variety of biological processes including signal transduction, nuclear mRNA export, vesicle trafficking, and synthesis of the lipid anchor glycosylphosphatidylinositol.  PI is synthesized at the endoplasmic reticulum from cytidine diphosphate diacylglycerol (CDP-DAG) and inositol in a reaction catalyzed by PI synthase (Pis1p). Synthesis of PI is increased by exogenously supplied inositol or zinc depletion. When cells are grown in inositol, PI synthase activity is greatly stimulated while phosphatidylserine synthase (Cho1p), which competes with Pis1p for their common substrate, CDP-DAG, is inhibited. Under conditions of zinc depletion, the transcription factor Zap1p binds to a zinc-responsive cis-acting element (UAS-ZRE) in the PIS1 promoter and increases PI synthase expression. Increased PI synthesis through zinc depletion or inositol supplementation leads to reduced CDP-DAG levels as well as its precursor, phosphatidic acid (PA). This PA level drop causes the Opi1p repressor to translocate to the nucleus, where it subsequently represses the transcription of many UAS-INO-containing phospholipid biosynthetic genes. Thus, in addition to its role in the biosynthesis of many important metabolites, PI synthesis indirectly contributes to the transcriptional regulation of phospholipid metabolism through its effect on intracellular PA level.

IPPSYN-PWY	mevalonate pathway	ERG10|ERG13|HMG2|HMG1|ERG12|ERG8|MVD1|IDI1		The mevalonate (MVA) pathway synthesizes the two common precursors to all isoprenoids: isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) and its isomer, dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP). The MVA pathway exists largely in eukaryotes and archaebacteria and is one of two pathways for IPP and DMAPP biosynthesis found in nature. The other pathway, the methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway, exists mainly in eubacteria and higher plants. Yeasts and other fungi employ the MVA pathway for isoprenoid production.  In <i>S. cerevisiae<i>, the MVA pathway begins with the condensation of two molecules of acetyl-CoA by acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase (Erg10p). This reaction forms acetoacetyl-CoA, which reacts with a third molecule of acetyl-CoA via 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) synthase (Erg13p) to form HMG-CoA. In turn, HMG-CoA is converted to mevalonate by HMG-CoA reductase in two NADPH-dependent reduction steps. This reaction is catalyzed by two isozymes in <i>S. cerevisiae<i>: Hmg1p and Hmg2p. Depending on culture conditions, Hmg1p accounts for around 83% of HMG-CoA reductase activity in wild type cells. After sequential phosphorylation of MVA to MVA-5-diphosphate via MVA kinase (Erg12p) and phospho-MVA kinase (Erg8), MVA-5-diphosphate is decarboxylated in an ATP-dependent manner by MVA pyrophosphate decarboxylase (Mvd1p) to yield IPP. IPP can then go to be isomerized to DMAPP via isopentenyl diphosphate:dimethylallyl diphosphate isomerase (Idi1p).  The addition of IPP units to DMAPP produces short-chain prenyl diphosphates that serve as precursors to many essential metabolites. For example, DMAPP can be sequentially condensed with two molecules of IPP to form farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP). FPP can undergo a long series of conversion steps in the sterol biosynthesis pathway to produce ergosterol, an important contributor to membrane integrity and the major sterol in <i>S. cerevisiae<i>. In addition to sterols, FPP is a precursor to many other primary metabolites including dolichols, ubiquinones, carotenoids, and polyprenols for protein prenylation.

In carbon metabolism, glycerol is a major byproduct of ethanol fermentation and can be used as a sole source of carbon under aerobic conditions. In osmoregulation, glycerol acts as a key osmolyte during hyperosmotic stress and is the primary compatible solute in <i>S. cerevisiae</i>. Biosynthesis of glycerol, as a NADH-consuming process, also plays an important role in maintaining cytosolic redox balance during anaerobic conditions by oxidizing excess NADH to NAD. Consistent with these functions, <i>S. cerevisiae</i> cells defective in glycerol biosynthesis are sensitive to osmotic stress and do not exhibit anaerobic growth.  Glycerol is produced from the reduction of dihydroxyacetone phosphate via glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, consuming NADH and forming glycerol-3-phosphate. In <i>S. cerevisiae<i>, glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase is encoded by both GPD1 and GPD2. GPD1 is induced by osmotic stress and is thought to play a role in osmoregulation, while GPD2 is induced under anaerobic conditions and may be involved in redox balancing. Glycerol-3-phosphate is subsequently dephosphorylated by glycerol-3-phosphatase, producing glycerol. There are two genes encoding for glycerol-3-phosphatase in <i>S. cerevisiae<i>: GPP1, which is constitutively expressed, and GPP2, which is induced during hyperosmotic stress.

PWY-5971-1	myristate biosynthesis	FAS2|OAR1|TES1|FAS1		Fatty acids are essential to all organisms except for archaea; they are major constituents of cellular membranes, and are used for energy storage and for posttranslational protein modifications. Most organisms are capable of synthesizing long chain (C12:0-C16:0) saturated fatty acids de novo.  Although the initiation and termination reactions may vary, the cyclic series of chain-lengthening reactions are essentially the same across all organisms. The fatty acid chain, which starts as a 2-carbon chain from acetyl-CoA, is extended two carbons at a time by the addition of an acetyl group from malonyl-CoA.  When the final length of the fatty acid is achieved, fatty acid synthesis is terminated.  Each cycle of chain elongation involves 5 reactions with the following enzymatic activities: malonyl transferase (EC: 2.3.1.39), ketoacyl synthase (EC: 2.3.1.41), ketoacyl reductase (EC: 1.1.1.100), 3-hydroxyacyl dehydratase (EC: 4.2.1.58, 4.2.1.59, and 4.2.1.61), and enoyl-acyl reductase (EC: 1.3.1.10). In yeast, fatty acid biosynthesis is terminated with the release of fatty acyl-CoAs from fatty acid synthase (FAS), the enzyme complex that carries out de novo fatty acid biosynthesis.  Palmitoyl- (C16) and stearoyl-CoA (C18) are the main products in yeast, while myristoyl-CoA (C14) is only produced in small amounts To synthesize palmitoyl-CoA (C16) one acetyl-CoA and 7 malonyl-CoA molecules are required.  The elongation substrate, malonyl-CoA is synthesized from the carboxylation of acetyl-CoA (EC 6.4.1.2) by the biotin-containing enzyme, acetyl-CoA carboxylase (Acc1p) Acetyl-CoA carboxylase is activated by the biotin:apoprotein ligase (Bpl1p) There are two types of FAS systems based on the organization of the catalytic sites. Fungi, animals, and some bacteria have type I FASs, which are large multi-functional proteins that contain all of the requisite catalytic active sites for fatty acid biosynthesis within domains on a single polypeptide (alpha) or on two polypeptides (alpha and beta). Fungal FASs are alpha6beta6 heterododecamers, animal FASs are alpha2 homodimers, and some type I bacterial FASs are alpha6 Bacteria, plants and mitochondria, on the other hand, have type II FAS systems, which are comprised of independent proteins, whereby each protein catalyzes a single step in the cyclic series of reactions The yeast FAS complex catalyzes a total of 8 reactions. The alpha subunit(Fas2p) catalyzes 3 reactions, ketoacyl synthase (EC: 2.3.1.41),ketoacyl reductase (EC: 1.1.1.100) and self pantetheinylation and the yeast beta subunit (Fas1p) catalyzes 5 reactions, acetyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.38), malonyl transferase (EC: 2.3.1.39),3-hydroxyacyl dehydratase (EC: 4.2.1.58, 4.2.1.59, and 4.2.1.61),enoyl-acyl reductase (EC: 1.3.1.10), and palmitoyl transferase (EC:2.3.1.-) FASs are regulated at the transcriptional and translational level as well as posttranslationally.  In yeast, FAS is a housekeeping enzyme that is expressed constitutively at a low level, but its expression is also activated by the general yeast transcription factors Rap1, Abf1 and Reb1 and theinositolcholine-responsive transcription factor heterodimer, Ino2p-Ino4p The coordinate expression of the two subunits also appears to be regulated by Fas1p controlling the expression of FAS2 The FAS subunits are further regulated by proteolytic degradation of excess subunits.

Each cycle of chain elongation involves 5 reactions with the following enzymatic activities: malonyl transferase (EC: 2.3.1.39), ketoacyl synthase (EC: 2.3.1.41), ketoacyl reductase (EC: 1.1.1.100), 3-hydroxyacyl dehydratase (EC: 4.2.1.58, 4.2.1.59, and 4.2.1.61), and enoyl-acyl reductase (EC: 1.3.1.10). In yeast, fatty acid biosynthesis is terminated with the release of fatty acyl-CoAs from fatty acid synthase (FAS), the enzyme complex that carries out de novo fatty acid biosynthesis.  Palmitoyl- (C16) and stearoyl-CoA (C18) are the main products in yeast, while myristoyl-CoA (C14) is only produced in small amounts To synthesize palmitoyl-CoA (C16) one acetyl-CoA and 7 malonyl-CoA molecules are required.  The elongation substrate, malonyl-CoA is synthesized from the carboxylation of acetyl-CoA (EC 6.4.1.2) by the biotin-containing enzyme, acetyl-CoA carboxylase (Acc1p) Acetyl-CoA carboxylase is activated by the biotin:apoprotein ligase (Bpl1p) There are two types of FAS systems based on the organization of the catalytic sites. Fungi, animals, and some bacteria have type I FASs, which are large multi-functional proteins that contain all of the requisite catalytic active sites for fatty acid biosynthesis within domains on a single polypeptide (alpha) or on two polypeptides (alpha and beta). Fungal FASs are alpha6beta6 heterododecamers, animal FASs are alpha2 homodimers, and some type I bacterial FASs are alpha6 Bacteria, plants and mitochondria, on the other hand, have type II FAS systems, which are comprised of independent proteins, whereby each protein catalyzes a single step in the cyclic series of reactions The yeast FAS complex catalyzes a total of 8 reactions. The alpha subunit(Fas2p) catalyzes 3 reactions, ketoacyl synthase (EC: 2.3.1.41),ketoacyl reductase (EC: 1.1.1.100) and self pantetheinylation and the yeast beta subunit (Fas1p) catalyzes 5 reactions, acetyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.38), malonyl transferase (EC: 2.3.1.39),3-hydroxyacyl dehydratase (EC: 4.2.1.58, 4.2.1.59, and 4.2.1.61),enoyl-acyl reductase (EC: 1.3.1.10), and palmitoyl transferase (EC:2.3.1.-) FASs are regulated at the transcriptional and translational level as well as posttranslationally.  In yeast, FAS is a housekeeping enzyme that is expressed constitutively at a low level, but its expression is also activated by the general yeast transcription factors Rap1, Abf1 and Reb1 and theinositolcholine-responsive transcription factor heterodimer, Ino2p-Ino4p The coordinate expression of the two subunits also appears to be regulated by Fas1p controlling the expression of FAS2 The FAS subunits are further regulated by proteolytic degradation of excess subunits. While the intact FAS multimeric complex (alpha6beta6 ) is stable, its individual subunits are rapidly degraded	1350093|7649444|17448991|15952903|365179|1100391|10785388|3528750|374077|7925441|1461729|7862526|11713312|1735446|8262967	sat-fasyn|fatty acid biosynthesis|fatty acid chain-lengthening	CINDY
