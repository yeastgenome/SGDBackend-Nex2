Mutations in the cytosolic tail of Kex2p, either deletion of the tail or substitution of Alanine for Tyr713, result in loss of TGN localization. Loss of Golgi retention results in a more rapid loss of mating competence of Mat alpha cells after shutting off expression of a GAL1 promoter-driven form of KEX2-Y713A. SOI2 mutants suppress the localization defect in Kex2p-Y713A and, unlike the parent strain, can mate well after 7h on glucose.",
