PMID:35149760	SGD:S000313936	Regulation information	gene	SNG1	SGD:S000003429	To further test the hypothesis that the YRM1 and YRR1 SNVs are gain-of-function mutations resulting in constitutive expression of additional transporters and other potential resistance genes (including AZR1, FLR1 SNG1, YLR046L, YLL046C, YPL088W, and YLR179C70), we used qPCR to directly evaluate the expression of three such target genes (AZR1, FLR1, and SNG1). To this set we added the YRR1 gene itself, since YRR1 activates its own expression via an auto-feedback loop.

In the absence of paraquat, the growth of mip1Δ cells was slower than that of the wild type cells (mean doubling time, mip1Δ=3.54 h, WT=1.55 h).2. Cells lacking either one of the O2•− dismutases (sod1, sod2) showed virtually no growth when exposed to the original paraquat dose (400 μg/mL).3. sod2Δ populations barely showed any adaptive response in terms of reduction in cell doubling time.4. In both cases (rtg2Δ and rtg3Δ), all cell populations failed to adapt (Figure 5A), and their capacity for respiratory growth was virtually unperturbed at the end of the experiment (Figure 5B).

Ndt1/YIA6: H1:D99C, H1:K102C, H3:W198C, H5:E300C, and H5:R303C all exhibited a transport activity below 10% of that of the wild-type. The double cysteine mutant H1–H3:D99C/K201C was inactive similarly to its single mutant H1:D99C; despite that, H3:K201C had 38% activity with respect to the wild-type Ndt1p. H3–H5:W198C/R303C was also inactive similarly to both its corresponding single mutants, whereas H5–H1:E300C/K102C retained 22% transport activity unlike both its single mutants which had an activity below 10% compared to that of the wild-type. Swapping the residues of the latter charged pair as in H5–H1:E300K/K102E completely inactivated the carrier.	RAHI13	2022-05-24

As shown in Figure 2A, deletion of HOG1 caused a strong sensitivity to tunicamycin 3. As expected, ire1 and hac1 mutant cells showed a strong sensitivity to the presence of 0.4 μg tunicamycin/mL, a phenotype that was not alleviated by the addition of GlcN at doses (5.25 mM) that provide some protection to slt2 (Figure 2B). However, at higher GlcN concentrations (11.5 mM), ire1 and hac1 mutants grew as a wild-type strain (Figure 2B).	RAHI13	2022-03-07

PMID:35628303	SGD:S000316869	Non-phenotype HTP				Transcriptomic response to different types of radiation as a model for human radiation therapy; we used RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) to assess and compare the transcriptional response to a 50 Gy PRT and XRT treatment. As previously determined, this dose resulted in an average survival fraction of approximately 45%. The transcriptome (~6600 genes) was assessed at an early (30 min after radiation) and later (90 min after radiation) timepoint.	JODILS	2022-06-07

PMID:35253883	SGD:S000314323	GO information	gene	CBF1	SGD:S000003821	1. Taken together, these data highlight a key role of Cbf1 in the regulation of both transcription initiation of (peri)cenRNAs and most of all in the accessibility of the centromere to the transcription machinery. 2. n sum, both our in vitro and in vivo data suggest that Cbf1 directly promotes a strong transcriptional roadblock at centromeres which contributes to the protection of centromere activity.

PMID:35253883	SGD:S000314323	Classical phenotype information	gene	CBF1	SGD:S000003821	Cbf1 deletion leads to an accumulation of cenRNAs at all phases of the cell cycle which correlates with increased chromosome mis-segregation that is partially rescued when the roadblock activity is restored.

These data show that ScMep2 Twin-His variants can translocate K+, with variants possessing the H348A or H348E mutation being the most efficient in K+ transfer (Fig. 6B). These results indicate that, as for AmtB, the mutations in the twin-His motif of the central pore of ScMep2 alters the transport selectivity.

Of these, two sites, S186 and S424, are specific for Fus3p. 3. These results suggest that Slt2p phosphorylates Cla4p-S351 during mitotic growth, but as cells enter the mating pathway, another protein kinase(s) hyper-phosphorylates S351 4. Altogether, we conclude that Fus3p negatively regulates Cla4p kinase activity by inhibitory phosphorylation; S186 phosphorylation is the major site of regulation and S425 makes only a minor contribution. 5. we conclude that Cla4p kinase activity is down-regulated by inhibitory phosphorylation by Fus3p at S186. Inhibition of Cla4p is required to help maintain Fus2p in the cytoplasm to regulate cell wall removal during mating. 6. down-regulation of Cla4p by Fus3p is required to maintain pheromone-dependent cell cycle arrest. 7. This result suggests that the inhibition of Cla4p kinase activity by Fus3p affected the timing and formation of the mating-specific septin relocalization. Taken together, we conclude that the balance between Cla4p and Fus3p protein kinase activities plays a general role in regulating the transition between mating and mitosis.	RAHI13	2022-04-26

These results suggest that Slt2p phosphorylates Cla4p-S351 during mitotic growth, but as cells enter the mating pathway, another protein kinase(s) hyper-phosphorylates S351 4. Altogether, we conclude that Fus3p negatively regulates Cla4p kinase activity by inhibitory phosphorylation; S186 phosphorylation is the major site of regulation and S425 makes only a minor contribution. 5. we conclude that Cla4p kinase activity is down-regulated by inhibitory phosphorylation by Fus3p at S186. Inhibition of Cla4p is required to help maintain Fus2p in the cytoplasm to regulate cell wall removal during mating. 6. down-regulation of Cla4p by Fus3p is required to maintain pheromone-dependent cell cycle arrest. 7. This result suggests that the inhibition of Cla4p kinase activity by Fus3p affected the timing and formation of the mating-specific septin relocalization. Taken together, we conclude that the balance between Cla4p and Fus3p protein kinase activities plays a general role in regulating the transition between mating and mitosis.	RAHI13	2022-04-26

Our results thus demonstrate that PP2ARts1 directly interacts with Rck2 via a SLiM motif in the C-terminus of Rck23. our results show that PP2ARts1 is critical for the timely deactivation of Rck2 kinase activity and thereby acts as a major antagonist of the Rck2 sub-regulon of the HOG signaling response.
